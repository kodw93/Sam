# # Update CDC Functions

# The purpose of this notebook is as follows:<br>
# 1. Create a function that grabs data from MongoDB (COVID19-DB/CDC-TimeSeries table)
# 
# 2. Create a function that takes in the dataset CDC-TimeSeries from MongoDB and spits out country, date, total_num_infections, total_num_deaths. 
# 
# 3. Create a function that takes in CDC-TimeSeries from MongoDB and spits out country, days_since_first_infection, total_num_infections, total_num_deaths.
