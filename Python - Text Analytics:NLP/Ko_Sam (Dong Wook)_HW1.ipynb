    "You are a business analyst working for a major US toy retailer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A manager in the marketing department wants to find out the most frequently used words in positive reviews (five stars) and negative reviews (one star) in order to determine what occasion the toys are purchased for (Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries.). He would like your opinion on **which gift occasions (Christmas, birthdays, or anniversaries) tend to have the most positive reviews** to focus marketing budget on those days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of your product managers suspects that **toys purchased for male recipients (husbands, sons, etc.)** tend to be much more likely to be reviewed poorly. She would like to see some data points confirming or rejecting her hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **regular expressions to parse out all references to recipients and gift occassions**, and account for the possibility that people may spell words \"son\" / \"children\" / \"Christmas\" as both singular and plural, upper or lower-cased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain what some of pitfalls/limitations are of using only a word count analysis to make these inferences. What additional research/steps would you need to do to verify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a simple Excel CSV file that contains 2-3 lines at most describing yourself, your background, and interests. It must contain at least 1 emoji and 4-5 international characters (non-ASCII). Make sure to properly encode the file so that I can open it in `UTF-8` to read. Attach it to your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the same word count analysis using the reviews received from Amazon to answer your marketing manager's question. They are stored in two files, (`poor_amazon_toy_reviews.txt`) and (`good-amazon-toy-reviews.txt`). **Provide a few sentences with your findings and business recommendations.** Make any assumptions you'd like to- this is a fictitious company after all. I just want you to get into the habit of \"finishing\" your analysis: to avoid delivering technical numbers to a non-technical manager.\n",

       "'Do not buy these! They break very fast I spun then for 15 minutes and the end flew off don\\'t waste your money. They are made from cheap plastic and have cracks in them. Buy the poi balls they work a lot better if you only have limited funds.\\nShowed up not how it\\'s shown . Was someone\\'s old toy. with paint on it.\\nYou need expansion packs 3-5 if you want access to the player aids for the Factions expansion. The base game of Alien Frontiers just plays so much smoother than adding Factions with the expansion packs. All this will do is pigeonhole you into a certain path to victory.\\n\"This was to be a gift for my husband for our new pool. Did not receive the color I ordered but most of all after only one month of use (not continuously) the mesh pulled away from the material and the inflatable side. Completely shredded and no longer of use. It was stored properly and was not kept outside or in the pool. Poorly made, better off going to W**-M*** and getting something on clearance.\"\\nReceived a pineapple rather than the advertised s\\'more\\nThis was much too small for an average size child to bounce on. It was the size of about a punching balloon. VERY DISAPPOINTING.\\n\"Don\\'t buy this. Cheaply made. Hippos get stuck. Cover for ball storage does not attach securely to the underside of game so every time they pick it up, the cover falls off and balls go everywhere. Can\\'t believe this game actually passed QC standards. You would think it was a 99 cent game.\"\\nNot so good ;-(\\n\"Misrepresentation of their products per pictures. I didn\\'t read the description closely, but they listed the item as a single model, however showed the picture of a battlegroup which included the model questioned. Pretty shady if you ask me.\"\\nVery difficult to inflate.  The valves are designed for beach balls not big recliners.  Totally disappointed.  Don\\'t waste your money\\n\"These packs are so overpriced for what you get, and you need packs 3-5 if you want access to the player aids for the Factions expansion. The base game of Alien Frontiers just plays so much smoother than adding Factions with these expansion packs.\"\\nDid not get charger or one battey\\nTerrible product. I followed the directions to the &#34;t&#34; and the gun has never worked. Complete waste of money with zero chances of a refund. DO NOT BUY.\\nBroke after two uses.\\n\"Sadness! My daughter used her own money that she worked hard to earn on these bubbles that she has been seeing on tv, and they don\\'t work. We can barely get any bubbles to leave the blower and when we do they pop instantly! Very disappointed. Wish she could get her money back to buy a toy without false advertising. Don\\'t buy! Zero stars!\"\\nBurnt through the balance traces and ruined 4 batteries at once.\\nVery disappointed. Expected a &#34;mega&#34; set only to receive this tiny set. Good for a 3 yr old.\\nWe bought this item for our daughter to play with on a long road trip. She was never really super interested in it like the regular size magna doodle.  My husband and I tried it out and it sucks.  Whatever you draw lasts maybe 20 seconds. There is no need for the slide bar to erase because it erases itself. Super disappointed!\\n\"For the price, it\\'s great but it is a little loose when you put it on\"\\nfailed to function right out of the box. piece of crap. this was a birthday present for a four year old grandson and you can imagine the disappointment on his face. My son is a doctor and even he could not get it to operate. Send it back to China with all the other Chinese junk we buy.\\nNot what I expected.\\n\"If I could give this zero stars I would. Partially my fault for not fully comprehending the description but also because this product was cheap. All but two were broken. Plus, there were three multiples in the set. Wish I could return it but my son already set his eyes on them and there is not taking them back. Also NOT FOR CHILDREN! Pieces are way to small, and the balls are way to hard.. Just waiting for one to get thrown across the room and shatter a vase.\"\\ngift\\n\"i bought this chair for my Grandson and it kept folding up into him. Everytime he tried to sit in it, it would flip over. Very poor quality my daughter in law put it outside with a free sign on it\"\\nDid not help at all and also very small...\\n\"It has done NOTHING but sit in my window sill, grow mold on the toy lizard they sent, and nothing has grown. I followed directions very closely and still nothing. Not satisfied at all.\"\\n\"Wish I would have read through the reviews before my purchase. The crown makes the headphones top heavy so they are constantly slipping off my four years old head. The sound is barely a whisper, despite having the audio controls to max, maybe as one reviewer mentioned I too got stuck with a flawed product. If there is other noise going on in the room you can forget about hearing anything through these headphones.  I am returning these and buying from another brand I purchased on the same order that work much much better and actually stay on.\"\\n\"there is no box that reset this game, quality of this item is bad i didn\\'t like it.\"\\nBased on the description that I read and the price I saw this looked like the big size car & I just got it today and its the tiny size car and the price u now have posted for it was not what I saw\\n\"Do not order this!!!  I also failed to read the fine print and reviews thinking the price was for all 6 not just for one.  Even after ordering and reading the review, it was very hard to fine the statement that you will only get one.\"\\n\"This doesn\\'t function as any of the things it advertises. There is no way to get leverage as a bottle opener and the ears stab your hand. The keyring comes off with little effort. The tiny screwdrivers aren\\'t large enough for most screw tops, not to mention if the screws are recessed more than 1 cm deep.  Im a huge batman fan and i love bat-merchandise but $10.00 plus 5 for S/H is not worth this.\"\\n\"Package says 6, mine was open and only had 4\"\\n\"These are fake. They are flimsy, broken or broke on 2nd day. Some won\\'t even close. My eldest son has a whole collection of real bakugans and these are nothing close to the quality of the real ones. Will be returning\"\\nNot good for playing with dogs. Brittle plastic that breaks and splinters way too easily..<br />Very disappointed.\\nSound did not work on tractor. sent back for refund. Thank you very much for refund.\\n\"very cheap.  The binoculars broke the first day, everything else ended up being sent to Goodwill.  I wouldn\\'t recommend it.\"\\nDisappointed with this puzzle. The pieces are very oddly shaped. Would only recommend White Mountain or Buffalo puzzles\\n\"Absolute garbage, such poor quality and a waste of money.\"\\ncame defective -\\nThe item came with robin suffering from a loss of limb. These are the most fragile toys I\\'ve ever bought. Def not meant to actually be played with. Batman\\'s jacket required a hot glue gun right out of the box. Ultimately the dog ate them. They\\'re dollar store trash.\\nBalloons do not fill up. Shoot off empty. Don\\'t pop. the product breaks when trying to use it. don\\'t send the return intructions. Bad product\\nWas very disappointed with this game. I have the original and we have enjoyed it very much. The Decades version is definitely meant for the younger generation. It has too many names of musicians in it to suit the group I play with (older adults). Sorry I wasted my money! I gave it to a friend to give to her teenage grandchildren.\\n\"Pointless waste of space in our home - my kids were so desperate to get this, and once we did, they played with it for a day before getting bored. The beads don\\'t stick together well at all, and then I\\'m left finding all the tiny beads that rolled under the furniture. I\\'m throwing this away as soon as school starts!\"\\n\"Amazing. These are like totally invisible. I know I received them because the packing lkist said they were in the box with other items. Couldn\\'t see them, couldn\\'t feel or smell them. The ultimate hidden treasure.\"\\nSmall\\n\"This lasted about two hours before two of the wires shorted out on one of the booms and fried the controller.  Now I have to remove everything and send it in to be tested before they will even think about replacing any parts.  The Hobbytown store I bought it at said too bad, call the manufacturer,  not our problem.  Don\\'t buy!  Update: Firelands sent the replacement parts, took hours to install, still doesn\\'t fly right, going in trash right now.  Might as well throw $100 out the window.  We bought a Syma X8HG for $135 on Amazon, and it is AWESOME.  Both my sons have them, my older son has the cheaper one without altitude hold and we love them.  The X8 series starts at $58 believe it or not, and they are MUCH, MUCH better quadcopters.  The Ares is JUNK compared to the Syma!!!\"\\n\"I received a notice that it was deliverable -  because I wanted to take them on a camping trip, did not try to reorder - I was very disappointed .  I may try again in the future, I do know that it is a fast and fun game.\"\\nwas cheap looking.\\n\"I never did get it to fly.  Eveything worked, but the electric motor would not run.  I called the company it came from and they wanted me to try some different procedures to try to fix it.  About that time, my dog stepped on the wing and broke it.  Probably not returnable now!  Kicked the dog in the butt and the plane went into the trash can.  Another day in paradise!\"\\nArrived broken\\n\"I just opened my Monopoly Zelda edition for game tonight. And I\\'m about to play but it is missing the Railroads a d Utility companies. (Bomb Shop, Potion shop)\"\\nFell off the bathtub and broke within a week.\\nThe crayons arrived broken because they were just stuffed into the bottom draw. It cased a cloud on my granddaughter\\'s birthday.\\nThis item could not even be considered to be called a complete product for market. Out of 2 items received both arrived defective due to absolutely absent quality control. It would be a shame to be presented as a gift for fellow chess lovers due to poor craftsmanship. Made with poor quality from cheap unfinished wood pieces in first place this item does not worth time and hassle to go through return process. Garbage.\\nGreat swing. My granddaughter loves it!  And it is a perfect fit for small people .\\nPoor quality\\n\"waste of time and money. Buy a pair of inline skates or go to a skating ring instead, way better.\"\\nMy nearly 3 yr old granddaughter is not as fascinated as I thought she would be when I read the reviews when shopping for it.  It\\'s turning out to be an unused toy.\\nOmg this product is waste of money period it broke when it came it is made out of Styrofoam materials very fragile i will be returning this item its a piece of garbage\\n\"Light comes on and off - and is incredibly frustrating...now have a tiny, useless, expensive car.\"\\nLow quality but for the price what should I expect? My son had a blast with this.\\n\"Looks cheap  Arrived DIRTY inside the wrapping - cause for concern because i almost overlooked it, and we all know how toddlers put their hands into their mouths....  Everything needed to be assembled\"\\nbad\\n\"Product did not work, leaked water immediately after filling.\"\\nReally unhappy with this product. The frame of the car was partially broken upon arrival. This product totally sucks. Don\\'t waste your time buying this!\\n\"Very tiny, didnt even work as a cake topper. Majority of the eyes were cross eyed and looked as if they were on drugs. Not worth what i paid.\"\\n\"These dinosaurs are TERRIBLE. The assortment shown is *NOT* what you get. Theyre cheap looking, several are ugly bright neon colors, some dinos are missing OR you get a duplicate, and to top it all if, they wont actually stand, which is guaranteed to piss off your kids. I was going to return them, but my kid found them first and, being only 2, his standards are low. But, within minutes he had a frustrated meltdown over the fact that they wont stand, and so any that didn\\'t have 4 legs went in the trash. Which meant 6 of them. So now, I have 6 crappy, cheap dinos that I cant return.<br />Basically, dont buy these, they SUCK.\"\\nIt breaks in 5 minutes.\\nChintzy.\\nWay too olio expensive for what it is. Save your money and get a larger booster pack for the same price.\\n\"These are terribly made -- the duster and mop fall apart quite easily -- the yarn is barely glued in place. Mellissa and Doug if you are out there, PLEASE do better!!  I don\\'t know what to do with ours other than put it in the trash at this point (I have tried fixing, not possible…) which means more junk in the landfill, after only being used lightly for a few months -- terrible… Parents, please keep looking for something that will not only last for your child\\'s use, but ideally that can be passed on to others before ending up on the junk heap… Sigh...\"\\nThese were not cotton.  We had to send back\\n\"Bought these dice sets under the assumption that they were new, because, well, that\\'s what the description said. The black set had no blemishes but the green set had numerous scuffs, scratches, dull points, and number &#34;touch ups&#34;. Don\\'t know what to make of the seller. Just want customers to be aware.\"\\n\"My kids love making loom bracelets, these were not the best quality, they start to break and become cracked as soon as they are put into a bracelet. Almost as if they were set out in the sun for days upon days and all they did was take them out of the bag and make bracelets. Absolutely none of their bracelets have kept for more than a few hrs!\"\\nstinks like spray paint. quality of design is a -1\\n\"First flight out , it broke.

Not at all worth the money.\\n\"Had to re-order product twice and still isn\\'t wearable. So this hat is a totally worthless piece of crap.

If you are looking for this exact item, do not purchase.  The package sent to us had similar pieces, but fewer outfits and many more accessories.  We were looking to replace an exact item that had been torn while trying to dress this tiny little rubbery doll in tiny little rubbery clothes (exercise in patience to say the least).  If your child is younger than about five, they will not be able to do this alone.  I don\\'t review the item very highly in general, but the fact that I received a different item than pictured was why I only gave it a single star.\"\\nboat was great for 3 days. motor died on our 5th time paying with it. returned for refund\\n\"Ok so this is plastic spaceship for a toddler.  I am not looking for German quality engineering here but this product is ridiculous.  The factory / designer made no effort whatsoever to calibrate their design so it actually works.<br /><br />Issues :<br />1, The space helmet has no way staying on the astronaut, the sizing is so off the sits on his head like he just grabbed the closes planter near by and called it a helmet.  Trying to place the astronaut in the spaceship with the helmet on is impossible.  There is not enough clearance to close the cockpit. So the helmet is useless, it just constantly falls off causing frustration.<br /><br />2, Ok issue number one can be explained by, oh son he does not need the helmet in the spaceship ok.....  However, the pilot itself it to large for the cockpit. A person really has to finagle and shove the guy in there to fit and for the cockpit to close.  Same goes for getting him in and out again  This is BS since the fundamental point of the toy.<br /><br />Dear toy maker, let me tell you the &#34;User Story&#34; for the product. Three year old using imagination play with spaceship and astronout having adventures.  For this the astronout has to be able to get in and out of his spaceship and travel to other locations and rinse and repeat.  What they should not be doing is getting frustrating with trying put together 3 pieces of outerly poorly designed garbage..\"\\nUsed it it looked good till I went to wipe off the overstay and all the paint wiped off\\n\"Working on this puzzle now and will take forever.  The pieces are cut so similar and are so small.  It would have been better to make this a 750 piece puzzle and make the pieces somewhat different.  I am piecing by color and subject which is hard because there is so many subjects in this puzzle.  Also the pieces do not stick together so  hard to manage.  I was expecting the same quality as before on Sunsout  puzzles, but this one fails.\"\\nIt became DIRTY\\n\"cute to look at but the food slips right off. ... the ends are too narrow.

Finally the lock on the guard is hard to open after it has been locked in place.\\n\"This toy is HORRIBLE.  I bought it for my 4 yr old to play with and he got so frustrated when the legs fell off. We would no sooner get one leg on and another, or two, would fall off.  The ant is very cool and now that the legs, head and wings are super glued together.<br />I did get to glue it so that only the legs and abdomen touch the ground.  Such a waste for a really cool toy.\"\\nOnly received one finger hand. I want a refund or the other 4.\\nThis were complete garbage. Completely fell apart as I was taking them out of the package. Don\\'t waste your time or money on these.\\nI was very disappointed. They did not stay upright.

If a kid leans against a side at all the whole thing tips over. Very upset with this purchase\\nI wish that they would have had a size in the description!  Extremely small!  Probably a choking hazard!  Do not recommend ...\\n\"There were 2 bags missing from our box. We called Lego directly and they are sending the replacement bags, but this was a gift and it was disappointing that parts were missing.\"\\nTerrible is all I can say. I was in a hurry and didn\\'t read the review and wish I had. It is way to hard to reload and shreds the bullets which are not cheap to replace. We own dozens of nerf guns and his is by far the worst. I should send it back.\\n\"The power cord came cut, so there was no way to connect the battery to power it on.  This was a gift, and I wasn\\'t able to open it until my son returned from school, and by then it was too late to do anything about it.\"\\n\"This should have been a beautiful puzzle.  However, no fewer than 6 pieces were missing.  The puzzle itself is darker than the photo on the package and this in turn made it difficult to identify pieces.  There was also relatively little variation in the shape of the pieces so that--in areas where there as no pattern to use as a guide (see upper left)--it was very easy to substitute a wrong piece for the correct one.  We were willing to put up with these last two issues given the beauty of the painting on which the puzzle is based.  But to find out that we were 6 pieces short after working on the puzzle for more than a week, was the last straw.  We\\'ll stick to Ravensburger puzzles from now on.\"\\nI dont have any items\\nFinally had a chance on a summer rainy day to put this puzzle together only to determine there were missing pieces.  Very disappointed as it was a gift for neighbor!\\n\"DO NOT BUY THIS.  Extremely cheap plastic, stickers come off easily, Stiff, Hard to turn. My son hated it within 10 seconds of opening the box.

This mark must have been from storage before shipment. We returned this bike, as we thought it was a one-time mistake. -The next bike we received had the same black tire mark on the frame. -The rear skewer was not included in the package. -After contacting Smart Gear they agreed to send the proper rear skewer and a new frame. -Smart Gear sent the wrong replacement frame. -Smart Gear finally sent the correct replacement frame. -Smart Gear sent the wrong skewer. -I sent the bike back for a refund.  Smart Gear\\'s quality control is pretty bad.  While they were helpful on the phone, they messed up twice on rectifying the situation.  Really abysmal customer service, in the end.  We purchased another brand\\'s balance bike. I would avoid any debacles and steer clear of Smart Gear, as it seems, perhaps, that they are too big to control how things are processed/controlled.

I\\'m a HUGE fan of Ultra Pro Products (They are the only things I use for all my card games cards ,Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic, Force of Will, and Pokemon) this is really the first in all my years of TCG playing I have hated one of their products! I have wanted to double sleeve my Standard Size playing cards for a while and I bought these BECAUSE they were Ultra Pro. I waited and was so excited to get them but when I tried them on all they did was Bow my cards! They were so tight I bent some cards trying to get them in! I then bought The KMC Perfect Fit ones and although the quality of these may feel better then the KMC ones i\\'m certain that the KMC ones fit PERFECT on all cards I listed! I bought 3 packs of these and through all 3 packs away. Don\\'t be fooled by the little &#34;Improved&#34; insert they put in with the sleeves too it doesn\\'t mean they are any better (Trust me I tried).

In order for it to work, the door has to be completely closed to push in a little black button that allows it to start. The timer and all of the buttons are pretend, and the only working thing in it is the spinning tray and lights that only function when that little button is depressed inward.<br /> When it came out of the box, the door latch was bent so it could not be closed at all, and trying to bend it the correct way ended up nearly cracking the door. I decided to just cut the latch off figuring that it doesn\\'t need to latch so long as the door closes enough for it to push in the black button. Even without the latch that door still would not close enough to work. I even let the kids push on the door as hard as they could to get it to work, and it still would not unless you jammed you finger in it to press the black button. I was fully prepared to just take it as it was since the kids still loved it until I found a microwave at Wal-mart that was half of the price, worked properly, all of the buttons were usable, and it came with a working timer.

It is a big box filled with (literally not metaphorically) useless bits of cardboard and a sheet with some toy code. The hello world example on the website is more complicated than the first few examples in the sheet.<br /><br />While the website or subscriptions to code examples may be useful, I suspect that anyone buying this will feel ripped off [as I do].

The twist handle broke off under normal use and left behind a sharp protruding plastic dagger.  Useless for use by my daughter now.

The package came with 3 attachments, each having balloons and black rubber rings to hold them on already assembled.  No instructions.  The item is for one time use unless you buy a refill pack, which would be VERY time consuming to do.  However, that aside we were ready to have a blast. That feeling was short lived!  I attached the first one to the hose and only half the balloons would fill.  The others fell off with pretty much no water.  The biggest balloon got to about 2.5 inches big.  I thought ok maybe I did something wrong. As I was trying to put the non filled back on the spout, the 10-15 that did fill deflated water.  Imagine the disappointment of my 3 year old!!  We decided to give the second spout a try.  Same disappointment, only worse because I realized at this point my fun planned activity is a bust.  We threw the third out and started crafting!!!

We’ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness. If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.<br />Human suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume. I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer, Holocaust or Slave costume. Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?<br />Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair. Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughter’s very real illness by removing<br />this costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.\"\\nProduct description and photo is misleading. Stars are a &#34;black shadow&#34; rather than a &#34;spec of light&#34;.<br />Product quality was as expected.\\nIt wasn\\'t modeling clay as advertised. It\\'s like play dough. Wish I could return it and get my money back to buy actual modeling clay for my son.\\n\"Don\\'t be seduced by the price. These are just so badly made. It\\'s annoying that not all the animals stand up because the legs are turned inward. It\\'s annoying that the trees and fence don\\'t stand. But the real reason not to buy these is that they\\'re simply not safe for small children because the paint is sticky and peeling, there is exposed glue at the seams.<br /><br />If you purchase these, you have three options. Option one: Give your kid a bucket of terrible toys with sticky, peeling paint, and glue gobs. Option two: deal with the bother of having to return them. Option three: throw them away. We chose option two.\"\\nNot at all what I was looking for.  Very disappointed\\n\"One floatie didn\\'t even inflate.

I called 5 times to have the parts sent to me and the rude staff kept putting me on hold. Do NOT waste your time or money with this crap!\\nIt turned up broken\\n\"Product arrived with the rear wheel assembly broken beyond repair. The parts #32 (SPST8550N) were shattered, causing the drive axle to swing around freely and mar the rest of the frame. The non-drive rear wheel (only one wheel is actually connected securely enough to the axle to drive it) was loose on the axle, apparently caused by one of the retaining washers having been broken. As a warning to other users, the assembly used looks prone to breakage - about 1/4&#34; of plastic retains a larger (~2.5&#34; diameter) molded plastic split-washer that attaches to the axle. If any portion of that cast plastic washer develops a crack, it will fail and tip the tractor when the axle swings free.<br /><br />It\\'s a good thing I didn\\'t even let my boy see this, let alone ride it; he would have been crushed at our taking it away and seriously hurt had he tried to ride it. I\\'m glad I caught it within the amazon return window and read some of the other reviews on here about the tractor being too small, it sounds (and looks like) the tractor isn\\'t for our boy.\"\\n\"Do not buy!

It was also smashed completely flat to fit into its &#34;packaging&#34; which made permanent creases in the sides of the crown, making it more football shaped and not round like pictured.  If you need a quick crown for Glinda it\\'s fine I guess if you don\\'t care about accuracy...its very cheap though and youll have to augment it to make it fit.\"\\nI dont recommand to but this Toy\\n\"This product is so much smaller in real life than it is potrayed in the picture. if you truly are looking for jumbo blocks (as the name implies) then this is not the product for you. it only has the rectangle blocks so it limits building options. in short, this product is wack, don\\'t get it.\"\\n\"Too short!!  Mine pop out of the yoke anytime the truck cartwheels. I have adjusted the yoke as far out as possible.  Yesterday the outside pin popped out, sliced through 50% of my A arm...

Do you know that illegal farms have been created in Wales to breed these majestic animals for slaughter?

This is what society has come to today, you people make me sick. THINK BEFORE YOU EAT!\"\\n\"This slide is terrible.  Like all of the other 1 star reviews, regardless of your water pressure, water only shoots out of some of the holes on one side.  We ended up clipping the left side tube pretty close to the hose connection so that water shot pretty high out of the first 20-30 holes or something like that....made the slide usable on a slight hill.\"\\nLarge Mickey balloon had a large slice in it :(\\nNot what you expected.\\n\"Not at all what I thought I was purchasing! I purchased this for my ten year old little girl. She\\'s always talking about wanting to build a robot (she actually wants to build a Battlebot) so, I thought this was a good place to start.....we were planning to use this as a science lesson for school. This thing is a joke! The &#34;robots&#34; are very tiny (like microbots), even she can\\'t get the prices to got together properly with her tiny hands. And the packaging was all messed up.

The stitching has already split open on August 24 and the inner bladder is poking out.  What a disappointment for my grandson.\\nThe first time I put air in it the seams began to split. The material also was not as durable as I thought it would be.

The inserts are of very high quality, and would certainly buy again, but the binder... damn. I\\'d be willing to wager that any binder from dollar general would be of better quality. Do yourself a favor and buy a good one from somewhere else that accepts inserts in the front/back, then just print pokemon photos that you can use as a cover sheet. My 6yr olds binder started coming apart before he was even done putting cards in it for the first time. I taped it up with large clear packing tape. Fingers crossed that i don\\'t have to explain this crappy binder to my son anytime soon, but i fear i will.\"\\n\"Bought this for my son\\'s 9th birthday present. Was very disappointed in the poor quality. We purchased this about 6wks before his birthday and wrapped it immediately. He opened it today and the hot glue that holds the strings to the plastic bar had failed to work on two strings! Nothing like tears for the birthday boy. Because we purchased it early, we missed the cut off date for returning the product. We also realized the support bar was broken as well.\"\\nThis bear is smaller then the picture.

I refer to your Cell Block Psycho children’s costume with the description that reads, &#34;Kids will look psychotic with our scary Cell Block Psycho Child Costume. With a look resembling Hannibal Lector, no other convict will dare mess with this one. Our kids\\' Cell Block Psycho Costume includes an orange prisoner jumpsuit featuring torn sleeves, one attached tattoo sleeve, zipper front and \\'Ward 10-31 print, broken wrist shackle and a brown half face constraint mask. The molded plastic half mask features bars over the mouthpiece cutout for the scary look of Hannibal Lector the cannibal. No one on their cell block will dare to mess with this serial kill mental patient in our scary Cell Block Psycho Costume for kids.&#34; My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  We’ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a children’s/adolescent’s mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel. Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness is very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.  Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder? Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.  Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughter’s very real illness by removing your Cell Block Psycho Costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.\"\\n\"Within a few days, it began to lose power and got slower and slower.

I\\'m a volunteer at a primary school clinic, and our kids are dropping baby teeth like crazy--at lunch, in their classrooms, and even in the hall right outside the clinic. We started out the school year (two weeks ago) with 30 tooth holders, and now we\\'re down to about 5. Amazon.com to the rescue! Well, not quite....<br /><br />I received my (well packaged, well padded) box containing the mini tooth chests within the 2-day Prime shipment estimate, which is good since we\\'re in a bit of a pinch. The bag contained 3 colors of chests--purple, pink, and orange. It would have been nice to get additional colors (such as the ones in the photo), but at this point I\\'m not picky; we just need something that will safely store those bloody baby teeth so the kids can take them home and let the Tooth Fairy do the rest. Having read a few of the negative reviews, I realized that I needed to test the chests before I brought them to school. The first pink chest closed just fine. The next one was was missing a tab that secures the &#34;lock&#34;--it didn\\'t stay closed. A third purple chest was missing a tab, so of course that one wouldn\\'t stay closed. I tested 20 of these chests, and only 6 would stay closed. After some quick calculating I realized that out of 144 chests, there probably were only around 40 that would stay closed. Sorry for the language, but that is some p*$$-poor quality control, and I am not a happy customer.<br /><br />I\\'ve started the return process stating that these chests were &#34;defective&#34;--hopefully I will get my $$ back so I can order tooth holders that will actually perform the job as described.\"\\n\"They do Not fill up very much.

The fins are part of a foam sleeve that was ripped in half before I opened the box. I rigged it with some rubberbands. Then the launch tube is full of holes which is a great idea for making sure the vinegar and baking soda mix EXCEPT there are HOLES in it so there is no way to fill it with baking soda. The baking soda just falls out as fast as you fill it.

Sorry, folks, spend the bigger bucks and be happy -- we have the Unbelievable Bubble (bought at same time as this one) and are much much happier with it (especially when used with the bubble solution that came with it ... wish it came with more!!).

As soon as he grabbed the first piece it was ruined within minutes because he put it in his mouth (which is a normal development stage for 12 month olds).

It\\'s also disappointing that it appears all m & d toys are being made in China. No thanks, I rather buy quality toys like haba and hape where I trust their standards and safety.\"\\nCheaply made. Just ugly quality. I\\'ll be finding my daughter a different costume. Sad to see something Disney made so cheap.\\nDid not have the USPCC stamp.

This current bike is poorly made and cheap.\\nThese things broke the first day. Not good quality. I should have gone to the dollar store & got the other ones.\\nThe water balloons fill up as advertised and it is a cool concept.  Unfortunately the rubber band ties do not hold water in balloons. And 80% plus are already deflated.  If you are in possession I recommend hand tying each balloon after it is filled.  Which defeats the purpose of this  product.

But only one arrived. Total rip off for that much money.\\n\"My 7-year-old LOVED this toy. We only played with it a few times at the fields near our house because it shoots really far. It was really fun, but the bow string got brittle and broke over the summer just sitting in her room. I, too, looked for a replacement string, but there are none. She was really upset and now she is anxiously waiting to ask Santa for a new one.  I will not be buying this brand again. Bummer.\"\\nFell apart the first day of use during my sons birthday party.

I hardly expected it to given the price, but sometimes you get lucky. The package only includes the charger (pictured),  and that does not even work for me. I used the 12v cable from my Turningy Accucell6 battery charger because the socket size is the same, and the red led came on. But when i plugged the battery in, all it would do is momentarily flash the green light and the red light stayed on, indicating it was doing nothing. According to the only included directions, which are on the front of the charger, when you plug in the charger to power the red light will come on. When you plug the battery in the green light is supposed to come on also. When I plugin a battery nothing happens except that momentary flash of green. It does not appear to be charging. I tried this with a 3S 2200 mah 11.1v battery that was depleted to 10v and an identical battery that was charged to about 90% at 12.3v and both did the same thing. There\\'s no buttons on here so its anyone\\'s guess to what its doing. And since the green light does not even stay on, I dont trust this thing.\"\\nThis came broke!\\n\"Alarm is a annoing beep sound from 80s, not a song! Song only plays if you press song button which is useless. Alarm will sound for 15 minutes unless turn off with inconvenient switch on the back.\"\\n\"This cover is not made well. Always slips off. Almost impossible to put on without a second person. I purchased it to keep the pool covered, but since it always fell off I gave up & left of off. It also has a hole after 2 months of not staying on.\"\\n\"Purchasing this was such a waste of time. First the package was kinda opened already. I thought &#34;crap, this isn\\'t gonna work. Someone had already purchased this it probably didn\\'t work&#34;. But, I decided to try it out. And... it didn\\'t work.\"\\nJunk\\nCheap looking.\\nSolid Quartz only in the middle. False advertising\\nNot worth the money.

My petite 4 year old daughter struggled to even breathe and move wearing it the first time for her Cinderella party until finally the poor quality zipper busted open within 5 minutes beyond repair. I couldn\\'t return it because I bought the dress over a month before her birthday so excited to have it for her party. Now I\\'m at the point of no return with a broken dress that wasn\\'t exactly cheap.\\n\"Prime complaints: The bear has a big gash extending from the right arm all the way to mid way point on the neck. This was hidden by the bow on the neck and thus was not apparent. The bear is also not of great quality. We already had a different teddy bear bought locally in US and compared to that this bear is way inferior. We could and should have returned it but my daughter who was waiting for this to arrive for a very long time, got attached and would not let us return.<br />Secondary complaints: The bear is smaller than what is shown but also even than expectation. Came after what was an eternity (though granted that was expected) but the tracking number was of China Post which obviously is of not much use.\"\\n\"This toy is a piece of junk. My son got it as a birthday gift and loved it, but the on/off switch broke in 5 minutes. We returned the first and ordered another one hoping we would have better luck and within the first day the lights quit working and the audio keeps skipping like a broken record, even after a second set of brand new batteries. We are keeping it because my son loves it and doesn\\'t want to return it, but it is very poor quality. Buyer beware!\"\\nNice try bootleggers try again next time\\n\"I ordered the penguin but a dog came instead. Was not excited about it being a dog but because it was sent as a gift to the person, Grandma Penguin, she loved it & kept it. However, I am very dissatisfied that it was a dog & not the penguin.\"\\n\"This is a piece of junk.  I purchased one from Babies R Us for my child\\'s first birthday.  When I took it out of the box, there were deep scratches in the plastic body.  I took it back to exchange it for another one.  After I put together the next one, I discovered that one of the plastic pieces that the canopy rod fits in was disfigured and would not accept the canopy rod.  After two defective wagons, I am going to have to get something that isn\\'t made by Radio Flyer.  Way to ruin my idea of giving an all-American first birthday gift, Radio Flyer.\"\\nVery Cheap toy.  The writing is only in Chinese.  And the sticker that is on the front was coming off when we pulled it out of the box.  I got this to give for toys for tots. and can\\'t do it.  Ended up throwing it away.\\nThese did not last long at all in my toddler\\'s shoes. Came off quickly. Definitely don\\'t work on any shoe with texture on the footpad (like crocs).\\nNot glow at all. Don\\'t buy this.\\n\"didn\\'t look anything like the picture.....small, hair was shedding.... the face was nothing like the picture.\"\\n\"I will say that when I originally purchased this item my daughters (5 and 3 years old) were thrilled with it. We\\'ve only used it a handful of times. In that time I have repaired multiple tears, always along the seams of the plastic, inside and underneath the pool. Given the way that this product is made, the pool continues to leak because it has become impossible to find the source of some tears, most likely hidden with the many folds around the slide. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This purchase has been a huge disappointment.\"\\n\"Many of them did not fill up, and they don\\'t pop. Great concept if it worked. Waste of money.\"\\n\"My son was so excited to get this, but it only worked for 6 seconds. We retuned it for another, and the second one also worked for a second. The customer service was exceptional. They were very quick to get us our new product and ups picked up the broken One at our home.\"\\n\"Very poorly made, it was already falling apart when it arrived.\"\\nTo small\\nDeflated after one use. It was awesome for those three hours.\\n\"This set is poorly designed junk. The hockey puck does not slide on ordinary paved surfaces, nor would it work on grass. Useless. The soccer ball is pathetic. Its basically a dog toy sold in a set for kids. You can get a much better soccer ball for children at any sports store. As for the sticks and net, what you are getting is basically HALF of what you need to have any real fun. You get one net, and two sticks. But there are four attachments for those sticks: two hockey and two lacrosse. The attachments go on by way of a crude lock-in system that requires pushing very gently on a button-- to make the attachments go on-- but that requires a very HARD push to get them off again. My son and I could not get the lacrosse attachments off the sticks except by squeezing HARD on that button. Unfortunately, one of the buttons was squeezed so hard that it went in-- and did not pop back out again. Now that stick is junk. We have just one stick now and its staying on its lacrosse setting. You\\'ll need to buy extra sticks if you want to enjoy this set with less stress, so that your hockey and lacrosse sticks are ready when your kids are and don\\'t need to be changed. But I wouldn\\'t even bother buying this set for its sticks because they are made from clunky metal-- why not just get your kids the right sized, lower-end equipment made from wood or plastic and that requires no assembly? The set makes enjoying sports horribly complicated.<br /><br />The net went together easily enough, but its not something I\\'d want to take apart and do over again each time they wanted to play. So it takes up a large part of our basement. What I dislike most about the set is the cheapness of the materials. It has great gift appeal: It was my preschooler\\'s favorite birthday present and his 7-year-old brother was even excited when it was opened. The picture on the box had my kids giddy to take it out right away. But once we had it out, and realized how little there really was to play with, the qualityof which was all around inferior, our excitement waned and this toy will probably make an appearance in next year\\'s yard sale. Its a flashy toy with excellent gift appeal: Its best use is pretend-play for little kids. But keep in mind it has all the caveats of a self-assembled toy.\"\\nSkeleton does NOT laugh or light up as description says it does.

It does not even have an SD card to store the photos, you can only transmit them to your cell phone and the images are worse than 320x240. In addition it does random 360 flips even though my fingers are nowhere near the button and I\\'ve tried several different modes to avoid this. And the worst thing is that when you download their app on to your cell phone it includes a virus that you can only remove by going back to your cell phone vendor. I almost feel like this is a product of the Chinese military and is being used to infect people\\'s cell phones. Whatever the virus is, it tried to gain access to my credit card numbers. I don\\'t think this is a coincidence. I was attacked right after downloading their app.\"\\nThis was a birthday gift for my 3 year old.  The tracks are great and you can do a lot with them.  However the quality of the cars is very poor.  The second day it quit working.  The lights came on and the wheels spun but it didn\\'t go anywhere.  New batteries didn\\'t fix the problem.

The pieces are also not completely interlocking so you are sometimes not sure if the piece it correct or not.\"\\nTERRIBLE!!!! So deceiving.  What you picture is NOT what you get.

Other than that, heres my list of complaints.  The first time it put it in the water it ran for about a minute and stopped steering. Retrieved it and it was full of water which killed the steering servo.  Sent it back for an exchange. Got the new one and it did the same thing within a minute.  Here\\'s the list of modifications I had to do to make it right.  1 - steering linkage wire is way to thin and does not make a watertight seal through the cheap rubber seal in the hull.  Had to fabricate a new through-hull seal.  2- when you reverse the boat it floods because the hull is 2 pieces and NOT sealed with any kind of glue or rubber.  Tried to separate the hull and the nose is glued in place so removing the 4 screws only allowed the rear pieces to partially separate. Used aquaseal around the seam where I could.  The connection plug to the steering servo gets wet with the slightest amount of water in the hull so agua sealed the plug. 3 - even when the steering servo worked, it does not push the rudder to its limits so the boat barely steers.  Had to fabricate extension levers for both the servo and the rudder to get the servo to push the rudder to its limits.  the rudder also had a tab that stopped it from steering to the limit on 1 side so had to grind that off as well.  SAVE YOUR MONEY - and buy a product that has had some R&D put into it.  After about 6 hours of labor in my workshop the thing finally works for more than a minute - it does go fast though but seriously not worth the money or effort.

Then, one of them stopped going backward so you couldn\\'t maneuver it,  then it would go backward for a couple of seconds, then stop and just jerk along.  Took it out of the water, and the same thing.  We decided to let them dry out and were out of town for the weekend.

I tried to look past that, and was excited to try the cube out, but it was extremely difficult to turn! I grabbed my lubricant and turned the cube appropriately to open it up and the piece snapped at the base before I could open it. Broken.<br /><br />Not only that, but I did not receive the cube which is displayed in the picture. The cube I received has very harsh edges and corers, unlike the nicely rounded, correctly colored cube in the main picture.<br /><br />Terribly disappointing after waiting a full month to receive the cube.<br /><br />Will not be purchasing again.\"\\n\"The only time it works is if the remote is with in 2 feet of the Morphibian Shark.

I tried two different sets of batteries and it still didnt work.  And yes, they were brand new batteries.  After i contacted the seller via the question and answer section, they asked me if I was sure they were new batteries..really??? and then assured me that their products use 9V batteries.  So, fine..I tried 9V and guess what.. they didnt fit! Because the slots clearly showed 4AA batteries!! I tried calling the number they gave me and no one ever answered or called back.

I supervised my son on each and every step and was highly exacting in how each part was labeled, treated, and assembled.  We put it together step by step with maximum care, and by the instructions, and it resulted in a robot capable of only 1/2 of 1 wheel rotation because of a FAULTY solenoid in the motor.  This literally resulted in my 6 year old spending the last half of his birthday party crying in a corner and wondering what he did wrong.  He did nothing wrong.

The only reason they were not returned is that it cost just about as much to ship them back as they cost in the first place.  We read the reviews, which were not good, but we like to decide for ourselves. Now we have.  If you tried to take a tally score on these pads, you would get writer\\'s cramp at best and carpal tunnel at worst.

Now i should clarify that I\\'m talking about the reader pen not the book. The book is fine. But the pen takes too long to set up and even then just doesnt work.

Motor partially function and one of the two rechargeable battery is dead.\\n\"Doesn\\'t even deserve one star. Purchased for my sons third birthday and stopped working properly within an hour. Poor design for bubble tray, but the biggest problem is the start button as other reviews have mentioned. Won\\'t stay on, or stays on and turns off, or won\\'t turn on at all. Almost equally problematic is the design of the wheels, which are much too small. We already owned a toy mower by step2, and my son loved it and bubbles so much that we got him this. While the other mower has large sturdy wheels, the wheels on this are flimsy, light and small, making it almost impossible to push on anything but a paved surface; ie, not only will it not turn on to blow bubbles, it can\\'t even be pushed on the grass. We purchased him another, cheaper mower by a different brand (maybe Fischer price?) and it is infinitely better in quality and design, and has nice large, heavy wheels that make it easy to push through grass. I didn\\'t return in time because I didn\\'t want my son to have to give up a new birthday present that he was so excited about, but no one else should waste their time or money on this toy, it\\'s junk.\"\\n\"The description for the toy is 6 inches, whereas the actual toy is 9-10 inches. I\\'m very disappointed that they would lie about this. My son wanted a Thor toy that was smaller and the same size as his other action figures, and now this one will be a giant.\"\\nNever received the product as promised and no refund.  Lame.\\n\"This is way too small, not at all what I saw at the airport. And the material is not soft or smooth. Not well made.\"\\nLess than week- stopped working.

Very disappointing..\"\\n\"Item was badly damaged, and took a long time to arrive.\"\\n\"The little bi-plane seemed perfect, until the drill to use in taking apart & putting together the plane failed. The forward gear worked ONE time before it worked no longer. Only the backward gear works resulting in a very disappointed 3year old and a thoroughly chapped grandmother.\"\\n\"This was a replacement of our old My Pal, this one can only be personalized with a name.  My daughter is 7, she has had Scout since she was a year old and wanted a new one because she slept with hers every night.  The new Scout/Violet is a huge disappointment and LeapFrog should realize they screwed up with the &#34;new&#34; version.  I guess my money went to an advertisement on the ear instead.\"\\nUnless you live in very very flat perfectly cleaned concrete DO NOT BUY.  It tips over and loses its bubbles.  PITA for a parent dealing with a two year old\\nWe gave to our child and in 6 hours it got broken. The metal hinges  out of the door fell out and wheels fell off.  Not designed for a toddler as it is rigid and easily broken. Going to throw away the semi truck but keep the match cars which are actually of good quality.\\n\"Okay, I ordered two of these because it shows that it has a number of cards from all kinds of decks but when i got my order, it only included the cards from 5ds and zexal or whatever. I can\\'t say the cards aren\\'t decent, but I wanted them for nostalgic purposes. If you are like me, do not order from here. Not one card was from the original series. And maybe i was just very unlucky, but I got 100 cards and not a single one was from the original series. If you like all of the series, feel free to buy, but otherwise don\\'t.\"\\nNot what i expecyed\\nNo Stars! This broke within the first week of having it and it came with a horrible smell that wouldn\\'t go away. Awful purchase!!!\\nVery poorly made & different from what is pictured.

Don\\'t waste your money!!!!\\nPrice paid 28.00 ...price on box 1.99...overpriced\\n\"This amazing looking rifle left my 6 year old speechless while walking through the store. Needless to say we &#34;had&#34; to buy it for his birthday. He had it for less than an hour before the action in the &#34;clip&#34; jammed and chewed up the darts. First of all Hasbro, its a magazine, not a clip. Second, the darts are really loose in the magazine and fall out of alignment easily. Third, when you need to remove the magazine to reload, un-jam, or throw at the wall out of frustration, that even I as an adult have difficulty removing. The caliber of the darts seems perfect for the barrel, but too small for the magazine and bolt to feed. DO NOT BUY THIS RIFLE FOR YOUR KID UNLESS YOU\\'RE A PLASTIC GUNSMITH!!! I\\'ve had to take it apart no less than 3 times in first week to remove chewed up ammo.\"\\nVery upset this clearly shows two stamps and I ordered 2 sets and only received 2 stamps total.\\nGARBAGE.  Was not even worth giving it to my son.  It went straight to the trash bin.\\nNot what it appears to be...\\nWeren\\'t what I thought they were.  Too small.\\n\"Disappointing for the hype and price.  Don\\'t buy it.  My six-year old granddaughter is very much into LEGOs, Rokenbok, and other building toys, but never got interested in Roominate - probably because it is difficult to put together, falls apart easily after being assembled, doesn\\'t make furniture that is fun for her, and so she only plays with the doll and bunny toys.  Waste of money after I was so excited to give her something special.\"\\n\"I bought these dresses for my sister.

My 9 year old played with them for less than a day and now they are just sitting around collecting dust.  First negative is that you need 10 AAA batteries, so we had to make trip to the store before he could even get started.  The game board is really thin and flimsy, so it has to be played on a hard surface.  Overall there is a lot of variety with the toy and what you can do. The excitement and fun fades really fast.  There are much better choices for you child in this price range.

First of all, the head separated to several parts in the first place, so that I have to carefully connect them together which is a very complicated work to do. But it is just a beginning. I also figured out that the tail can not be connected to the body because the articulation is basically wrong ! The hold used to articulate is way too small, it is impossible to connect the tail. Moreover, other articulations are very easy to detach, especially the toes. When I tried to adjust the post, they just detached. It is very uncommon. The quality should not suppose to be that terrible. Therefore, I have to conclude that it is a faulty product. Ironically, the seller is Amazon.Com. I don\\'t know if they did it for purpose. Because I got it 10 dollars cheaper than the current price.\"\\nWould not buy these again. They leaked and didn\\'t fill full.\\n\"Gave this to our 2 year old son for his birthday and he loves it!

After having it about 4 weeks it broke right in half.  We kept it inside during rain and my 5 year old played with it outside in the dirt and sand.

My 7 year old son wanted this set so badly. First I\\'ll start with the instructions, or shall I say lack of instructions. They should take a lesson from Lego! They know how to write directions. This set is for 7+. I am a 45 yr old woman and pretty good at building sets. I was so frustrated putting this together after about 30 minutes I put it all back in the box for my husband to build. My son had to wait 2 days before he had the time to work on this. He is in construction and even he was frustrated putting this together. After about an hour, we figured out there were so many pieces missing we couldn\\'t even finish, and I don\\'t mean 1 or 2 pieces missing, or even 5-6 for that matter. Also, the Zombies are supposed to stand on a, what I would call a Lego type brick. They would not stay on the brick. They just kept popping off, on the ones we were actually able to get on for a half a second. Worst toy ever. I have a very disappointed 7 year old, and 2 seriously irritated parents. What a huge waste on money. If I could have given this a negative star I would have.\"\\nmeh\\nThe item looks nothing like the picture.\\n\"Didn\\'t even get off the ground.

I decided to take a chance on it anyway, figuring that maybe people who had this experience would be more likely to write a review, and that it probably doesn\\'t happen very often. Unfortunately, I now think this is the norm for this product and not the exception. The cards I received were coated in some sort of white powder that I just spent 20 minutes trying to wipe away (not a great experience as my guess is that it\\'s some sort of chemical), and even after the cleaning process many of the cards are still unusable. I really like the concept of this calendar with it\\'s storage pockets, two-sided number cards in yellow and red, and both English and Spanish words. However this really isn\\'t an acceptable way to offer a product. I now need to try to figure out how to get replacement cards, and to be honest I don\\'t really have much confidence that the next set will be any different.\"\\nItem was previously opened and pieces missing.

The hooks are fine if you are fishing for goldfish!\\n\"Parts were rusted, quality of product very bad.\"\\nlol 500 bux\\nDid not work even for a completing one entire life of the battery (which is supposed to be about 20mins tops). It stopped in between a couple of times after 5 minutes of flying. And then in next couple of minutes it just would not start. We tried to dig into the problem but could not get it to start. It hardly ever bumped anywhere while flying to stop working because of that. Product returned. Return was extremely easy. Got refund as soon as I shipped the package for return.\\n\"The color is not even, has a lot of whitish parts. Also, the black strap is paper and is pasted poorely and is easy to fall apart.\"\\nCheaply made. Paint job is horrible. The flashlight has already broke. Would not recommend.\\nPiece of junk and customer service is horrible. Actually wanted me to get someone to &#34; fix it &#34; right out of the box. Try the Ohuhu. A lot better !\\nLove the car but the products packaging is all smashed and half open. Very very disappointed.\\n\"Terrible product.  Battery contacts rusted after 1st use.  Battery compartment is mis-sized so battery slips off battery contacts and the compartment needs to be re-opened (with a screw driver) and the battery realigned.  It is almost impossible to remove the battery once it is installed--needle nose pliers and screwdriver required.  The boat costs $7.00, but you\\'ll expend tons of frustration.  Would not recommend.  Returned item because it was non-functional after one use.\"\\n\"I want to give this 5 stars.  This is my son\\'s favorite toy. He had a blast with it this winter after opening it at Christmas.  However, the quality is so poor. It did not even last a winter season.  Not only does the plow fall off constantly as past reviewers mentioned, but it has several large cracks and pieces chunks of plastic.  I emailed Bruder and was told I could purchase replacement parts, but you can\\'t replace the main truck cab.  I\\'m extremely disappointed in the quality of this product, but even more than that, I\\'m disappointed with Bruder costumer service.  We will be sticking to Tonka products from now on.\"\\nHard to press the pieces together. Got frozen not princess.\\n\"This toy worked for all of one week, then the reverse gear stopped working and the forward gear became intermittent.  This kids loved how slick the car looked, but underneath it all is just another hunk of junk from China to fill American landfills.  Pure crap.  Avoid this product.\"\\n\"Was disappointed, then end didn\\'t even fill all they way with water.\"\\nJust bad. Doesn\\'t play music or do anything. You have to hit it really hard to even make the drumsticks light up. One of our sticks didn\\'t even work. Returning.\\nHorrible. Disintegrated in the tub\\n\"Junk, I wouldn\\'t let any child play with this toy.<br /><br />The box contains numerous spelling errors which is suggestive about the quality of the materials used if the manufacturer didn\\'t think it was worth the cost to hire out a native English speaker to check the spelling.<br /><br />In addition, the seller didn\\'t disclose the appropriate shipping weight to amazon, so this complicates the return process if your local UPS refuses to accept the package with the return label from amazon. The seller says this weighs 1lb when  the product actually weighs 1lb 10 oz , with a typical box that will fit this, it is over 2lb. I cut down a minimal cardboard box that exactly fits this product and got the weight to just under 2 lbs.\"\\nThe hat looks NOTHING like the picture. So floppy like a fisherman\\'s hat. Have to buy a separate one now :/\\n\"Junk, don\\'t waste your money.\"\\nThe assembly that you can dump the water in at the top does not go together well at all! It keeps falling apart. Not to mention it is not seated on the base at all. It just keeps falling over. Very poor quality!\\nWhat a load of junk. Bought for my grandson. only one was successful. He was disappointed.\\n\"Terrible jewels, extremely small and wasn\\'t even able to see them on tables. Very unsatisfactory!\"\\nIt fell apart as soon as I opened the package because of the glue\\nit is not magnetic\\nThe stickers do not stay stuck on the page!  My son has been saving stickers for a sticker book for a while.  I was very disappointed to see that the stickers roll or peel off easily.  We are using all sorts of different types of stickers and none stay on.\\nMy daughter loves this toy when shes not crying over the magnets being spilled all over.  It is a great idea over all but the engineering is lacking.\\nBox was damaged. Will provide pictures.\\n\"This set was terrible.  We tried sand of many different consistencies at the beach but it all fell apart when we removed the mold.  It was very disappointing for my son.  I wish I had noticed how many of the positive reviews had not actually taken the kit to the beach, as well as how many had left a positive review in exchange for some kind of a promotional discount.\"\\nThe material is cheap. And the lights only light up in the first time.\\nDoes not form to your face properly.  Very uncomrfortable.\\npoor quality\\nBad quality<br />Pumped easily\\nCheap knockoff.Not as good as real LEGO.\\nIt\\'s is super complicated and you need glue and tape would not recommend if you don\\'t like vary few instructions and to many pieces.\\n\"I am totally disappointed that an item costing this much would be of such poor quality.  Upon opening the package and removing the wrapper from the screen, I immediately noticed half a dozen spots, some larger, some smaller where the drawing/writing would not come through.  Upon trying it out, I was further dismayed to disocover that along one whole edge (left edge of the screen) nothing comes out until I am drawing about three quarters of an inch away from the edge!  The item is made of very flimsy plastic and, given the various defects, is definitely not a purchase i would recommend to anyone.\"\\nrather klunky-\\nAwesome quality thanks Amazon. com and Toys and game outlet for a Sanei Japan official Larry Koopa Plush\\n\"Terrible, absolutely terrible! Made of painted trash bag material, litterally. Don\\'t buy this! I already sent it back.\"\\nThis chalk STAINS! My son\\'s clothes are ruined and it stained my brand new patio.

The wood pieces made available to hold the pieces are very flimsy and poorly made.\\n\"HORRIBLE. About 1/3 of each bag were broken.

Enough said.\\n\"We bought this with our wagon, and when we first bought it we had a porch we could leave it on and it was covered so we weren\\'t worried. We bought a new place and the porch was not covered and we had to wait to buy our outside building. Well this bag would NOT come back off so we could bring it in when we weren\\'t using it. So it was disgusting and the only way I could get this off was to cut it off from end to end. I hate this bag. I tried to contact customer service and the continued to ignore my emails and I couldn\\'t get through on the phone line. I can not describe how much of a headache this was and now I\\'m stuck with a wagon with this ridiculous extra metal piece attached.

This tensioner is only an aluminum alloy replacement for the stock piece. Its very hard to reach, and you need to remove it to adjust it. Basically, if you &#34;NEED&#34; to have this piece in aluminum, get it. If you don\\'t care about aluminum extras, you definitely don\\'t need this.<br /><br />What you do need is a front belt tensioner. Not for the front belt, but for the middle belt. But it mounts more forward on the upper plate. Since this is a counter steer car, the pulleys are smaller than stock to overdrive the rear wheels. There is way too much slack on the middle belt. I Googled all over and couldn\\'t find one. Except for a 3Racing tensioner that is made for another car, but will work on this one. Amazon does carry it.

Of course, when we decide to put them on as we\\'re going to the club 2 out of the 4 headbands DO NOT WORK.. AT ALL. The point of the headbands was not for the color, but for the lighting up so we could find each other easily if we got separated. Very annoyed that not one but TWO were complete garbage.

Goes to sleep too fast. Pulling on the tongue doesn\\'t always work. The remote does not work. Even though I keep the rooms well lit since it needs light to operate, it still doesn\\'t do all that\\'s said here. Not worth $50. Maybe 20 bucks. I already destroyed the box when I was opening it.

When I opened the package this tiny pony laid in the bottom of the envelope I laughed because I\\'ve never seen anything so ridiculous. I was really disappointed though because my daughter has been really wanting this pony.  I paid 24.99 for this misleading tiny toy.\"\\nBroke with my 22 pound grandson in it.  And Intex has no return policy on it. Baby loved it. Im dissapointed in company policy.\\nThe costume it self is cute but it is not true to size.

It warped and peeled off my car window in less than three days.  :(\"\\n\"This drone did not work for me, it came with one of the motor broken.\"\\n\"Somewhere, the engineering of this helmet missed the mark. The straps have been built for an adult, not a child, making the buckle that is supposed to sit beneath the chin, actually sits closer to my 5 1/2 old son\\'s right ear as the left strap is way too long and not adjustable! It looks beyond uncomfortable and just plain awkward. It basically looks like a little kid trying to wear an adult helmet, with the straps cinched up as far as they can go. The only fix, besides sending it back, is to cut the left strap down to size and use an industrial needle and thread to sew the straps back together. I even tried the helmet on my big, adult head and the straps fit me perfectly. It\\'s too bad I\\'m not into race cars. Seriously disappointed.

Would not recommend especially if you want something that will be a keepsake. The backing that was glued to the cover was crooked and the binding was not all the way glued.  Since I paid so little for it I didn\\'t even send it back but would advise anyone to purchase with better quality if you want to keep this for a long time.\\nHorrible quality. I feel like even the 5 year old I bought it for will feel this way too. The material was literally paper and was not sewn all the way.

Oh, it makes tons of bubbles just fine, just as well as the Gazillion Bubbles Hurricane machine, however the bubble liquid reservoir on this one is so tiny that you have to refill it every minute or so.  The other Hurricane version lasts much longer between refills.<br /><br />What would really be great is if they designed a reservoir that could be closed so that it doesn\\'t spill everywhere if you bump it.\"\\nI cannot give it a rating until I can figure out how to play it on the keychain.

Well, I could not have been more disappointed in this toy.  What I thought would be sturdy construction, turned out to be cheaply made.

I have never posted a review before so be assured that I feel very strongly about this. I received the fruit and vegetables 2 days ago and yes, the seams from the molds are rough and SHARP!  If not filed down, these seams could definitely cut the skin. I spent too much time filing the seams of each piece with a glass nail file. I did this because they are cute and too cheap to mess with returning. These products should be taken off the market. Amazon, you should not offer them to your clients.\"\\nDo not buy this product.

I suppose the land must be extremely flat to work. Our land we placed it on was not perfectly straight (close though!) and the pool was lopsided. My husband did his best to try and make it work, however a week after being filled up the pool was completely drained overnight. The seam split somehow. Would never buy this type of pool again.\"\\nVery disappointed. Opened the box and we received pencil sharpeners not glasses.\\nDo not buy\\n\"Totally waist of money! This thing is made of paper, it doesn\\'t properly folds like it\\'s on picture (the roads keep going up forming an arc) and kids will ruing it in an instant. This thing looks like a commercial that you see in a toy shop - it\\'s colorful and if you will fold it right and will not touch it it will stand and attract customers.\"\\nDoes not look like the color in the picture at all.

It\\'s an updated version of the flimsy stock that came with the Recon CS-6 with the same fatal flaw: The two orange pieces that connect the main stock to the mounting bracket are flexible and move in a slight breeze, much less when you try to actually use this stock as a stock. Seriously, Nerf, how hard would it be to make these things sturdier? I can\\'t believe you reused this design. I\\'m guessing it was to keep the cost of the Modulus from going any higher. At least it does let you carry an extra clip, but that\\'s the only positive thing I can say about it.  Seriously, don\\'t buy this. If it comes with your Modulus, fine. If you\\'re buying the parts a la carte, get the blaster stock or use one you already have. Personally I\\'m hoping Nerf puts out the Raider stock in Modulus colors as a future accessory so I can throw this thing far, far away.\"\\nStopped working after 3 weeks .  This toy is expensive and unreliable. The seller does not answer to my messages.\\nReceived one that stopped working after 2 nights. Complete waste of money.\\n\"Poor quality product- the launch ramp air valve wasn\\'t fully adhered and leaked immediately, plus another leak in the inflated end - both problems before fist use, right out of the box. Poorly designed water holes on the side make the edge roll over and squirt the wrong way, with no way to fasten down to achieve the appropriate angle. Small plastic pins to hold the slide in place are extremely ineffective. This was very frustrating for something that\\'s supposed to stand up to kid use. Definitely not impressed.\"\\nThis says waterproof but is not designed to be used in water. Eyelashes fell off within hour of being gently played with.

Only a few of them filled right.\\nDidn\\'t work right out of the box\\n\"I read previous reviews on this toy and decided to purchase it for my two year old son who loves anything car related.  Customer service from both Amazon and Holy Stone was excellent, but that doesn\\'t make this product itself any better.<br /><br />The first toy delivered was broken out of the box. The lights and sound all worked as expected, but the car did not move at all. The radio controller lit up, but no movement. I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and understanding. They sent out a replacement toy at no cost and I didn\\'t have to return the broken toy.<br /><br />The replacement car arrived today. My son got all of three minutes of movement/enjoyment before the toy stopped moving. As before all the lights and sounds work but the car refuses to move. The wheels don\\'t spin at all.  I would rather the toy never have arrived because now my son is upset that his car won\\'t drive.<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing experience.\"\\n\"ITS NOT THE RING PICTURED<br /><br />it has a storage compartment and the hatch to open it, it looks stupid with the hatch on it<br /><br />wish i would have gotten the picture that is advertised<br /><br />you can see it sticking out in the picture\"\\n\"Delivered below estimated date, good price, but low item quantity.<br />It states on the back &#34;Four in a pack&#34; but only has three.<br />After trying them out I found that they don\\'t work as they should, it says &#34;bite&#34; but you mostly have to chew it ten to twelve times.<br />And the color was more pink then red.\"\\nI was really disappointed when l ordered it l thought it was all the way around but it didn\\'t have a back side only in front so it had to be sticked against the wall so it won\\'t show and the shipment weight was 3.5 pound but they lied it was 6.1 pound which I had to pay more for the shipment\\nthe game is confussing and takes to long\\n\"does not stay open when the step stool is open ,, defective design. side wall would collapse\"\\nIt was too small\\nDo not waste your time.

I had already gotten a Kyogre plush at a convention a while ago and wanted a Groudon to go with him, this is not what I was hoping for.  When he got here I was astonished to see this tiny aluminum-type wrapper, not a box mind you, a wrapper that was so tightly bound around him that when I opened it up I was hugely disappointed at how deformed he was.  His head crests were bent over and no matter how hard I tried I couldn\\'t get them in the proper upright positions, his right arm was bent as though he\\'d broken it at the elbow, and the spikes on the end of his tail were pressed off to the side.  So needless to say, I would not recommend purchasing this guy online unless you can request/specify you want him shipped in a box so that he doesn\\'t show up at your door looking like he went through some sort press machine.\"\\nThis item comes in four different pieces that don\\'t fit together very well.

Right out of the box...two defective prop motors. I\\'d rather have root canal than to try and get satisfaction from a return policy issued by a Chinese company. First off I believe these  manufacturers have no &#34;quality control&#34; system in place. This is the second time I\\'m going down this rocky road, receiving a supposedly &#34;new defective\\' product.  No More!<br />They want you to send then a Video of the product and upload it to uTube so their techs can determine what the problem is. If they agree it is defective prop motors they will send you new ones to &#34;install\\' yourself, (better  have a soldering kit and know how to solder tiny electrical connections.

It was a long two days without it. I was really impressed with how well the original held up in the wash. We washed it along with her bedding, and hadn\\'t had any problems with matting, coming unstitched, etc, not even with the bow. Hopefully this will be the same.   Update (four months later): I\\'m not at all please with the quality of this replacement dog. It really looks like a matted-haired rat. My daughter still loves it, but it is quite embarrassing to take this now ugly toy with us. It\\'s so bad even family members cannot recognize that it\\'s supposed to be a dog.\"\\nWould give 0stars but can\\'t\\nNever did receive the motor assemblys I ordered. Got separate gears with the wrong shafts and motors that looked used and did not last only a few flights. One motor literally fell apart after one flight.

Then at 1 year and a month after we purchased the product the motherboard is defective and the quadcopter won\\'t fly. I called Heli-max warranty department, which by the way is a third party company, to see what they can do and they basically said no can do, they could not even sell me another mother board at a discounted rate.

Didn\\'t fit my 7 year old boy.\\nI\\'ve bought two of these boats now and a spare battery. The boats work great out of the box (even better if you connect the wires directly from the propeller rods).  The first boat I purchased worked for a couple runs before one of the motors started to malfunction.  Now the boat turns in circles instead of going straight because one motor still operates at full power.. I reluctantly purchased another boat (it\\'s a great boat for the price.. when it works..). This second boat lasted for about 5 to 10 minutes in the water before it just stopped working. I emailed the seller to request an exchange or return and received an email with return instructions stating there would be a 25% return fee.. and I have to pay return shipping.. basically I guess what I\\'m saying is that I now have 2 broken boats and 3 working batteries. Don\\'t bother wasting money on this junk.. you can have mine for free (+shipping!)\\nThis was the second one we purchased and both of them leaked within the first week. The patches they send with the Jump O Lene are useless because both leaks were on the seams so they just wouldn\\'t hold.

This was the main reason for ordering this item very disappointed..too much trouble to send back\\n\"This product is garbage, maybe the only thing worse is their (Parrot) customer service.  First drone had a motor stop mid flight, contacted Parrot first. Took them 3 business days to reply via email, which they just requested additional information - I also called after their advertised 2 business day response time. After waiting on hold for 27 minutes, yes 27, I gave up and hung up.  Luckily amazon was able to replace the faulty product.  Second drone arrived, it was used, in a torn box. After 2 minutes of flight all of the motors cut and it crashed - luckily from a 3 foot height this time.  The magnet that holds the inside or outside frame on did not work. The hull of the product is substandard.  Had I read their support website prior to ordering I would not have bought this. Just take a look, it outlines how to replace all of their faulty parts in videos. My advise, do not waste your money.  You would be better off with an air hogs drone than this.\"\\n\"After only a year, all 4 of these Nerf laser tag guns are not working.  There is something wrong with the software.  We\\'ve tried new batteries but nothing works.  It\\'s a shame to see a great company like Hasbro kicking out such poor quality.  For nearly $200, I would expect these to last a minimum of 3 years.  Sent a note to Hasbro customer service.  I\\'m guessing that will go nowhere.  What happened to the days where manufacturers made good products and stood behind them?  I suggest you keep looking for a gift for your son.\"\\nCheap and not worth the money!!!\\n\"This thing was very frustrating to try to assemble.  Took hours.  Anything that you had to use their tape to attach, fell apart as soon as you put the piece on.  I\\'d get the thing assembled and try to get the balance right to get it to float, which was almost impossible.  It was either going to rise or drop.  I\\'d try to get it to swim and it would stay in one place and just wiggle it\\'s tail as it would either rise to the ceiling or drop to the floor.  It would not swim.  After about 8 hours of working on it, I quit and went to bed.  Next morning, I found that every piece of tape, sticky stuff, had fallen off and it would need to be completely reassembled.  I cut holes in it to deflate it and trashed it.  It was very trying to deal with this junk.\"\\n\"Yes, these are cute, like many of the reviews say, but waaay smaller than described. Totally not what I had in mind! The description makes you think they are 1x12 (which would have been perfect) and then the dimensions listed say 10 inches, but obviously, only 8! And that\\'s with it laying flat. Very disappointed in his product!\"\\nReturned. Box was crushed and crown was broken.\\nit was broken.\\nLook$ nothing like picture. Cardboard oval glued on elastic band with feathers glued on it\\n\"This product was a huge disappointment. First of all, there was a $1.00 (clearance) sticker on the back of the bag. I paid over 5x\\'s that amount for the item so I felt a little jipped. Oh well. At least I had the the.... Not so much. The rubber bands were all dried out and when we tried to use them they snapped, one by one. Huge rip off :-(\"\\nMainly shuffled cards from one side and not from the other.\\n\"The kits we have gotten from Lowe\\'s & Home Depot have been much better quality and more kid friendly than this brand. My 6 yr old daughter had a terrible time w/this and when I tried to help I noticed the holes weren\\'t pre-drilled where they were supposed to be and when you hammer one side, nails that were already hammered in on the other side fall out. Both of ours fell apart within minutes of attempting to race them. Now I have two upset kids. Terrible, cheap product. Waste of money.\"\\n\"These little telescopes are awful.  The &#34;glass&#34; is so blurry, you can barely make out the colors of objects, and definitely can\\'t tell what those objects are!  It\\'s like the opposite of a telescope.  They would be better off having nothing in there.  I had planned to use these as a party favor for a Peter Pan birthday party, but am returning them because even my daughter thought they were dumb.\"\\nThe wig look old\\n\"Bought it for our one year old\\'s birthday. Total pain to put together and lo and behold - it leaked! Through the legs. So we had to put it back in the box, total pain, and now looking for one to reorder. And now I\\'m reading all these reviews about leaking legs going back years -- WHY THE BLEEP HASN\\'T THE COMPANY FIXED THIS ISSUE?!? I can\\'t believe people still rate it highly, even with all these leak issues. Ridiculous.\"\\n\"Does not work. Tried replacing batteries with new Durcells, but that did not fix the issue.\"\\n\"Instructions are pathetic and the motor in our kit had a broken shaft (the one that drives the bottom gear). While we did not pay for it, it was a prize my son chose for meeting a fundraising goal.\"\\nThis game arrived damaged.  The game box was crushed on two sides and several of the playing pieces were broken.\\n\"The page very much looks like this is the price for a set of four.

I didn\\'t have high expectations due to the price, however, it worked only 1 time, 1 squirt! Totally not worth the time to order. I would have returned it but it wasn\\'t worth the effort!  No star would be my pick if that were an option!!\"\\n\"Advertised as Elsa, picture was Elsa and I got Anna.\"\\nReally hard to put together because the pieces are so tiny and all the same color.\\nExtremely small and not convenient to mount inside the locker.\\n\"We bought this at a local store, not amazon.com.

This is TINY!  smaller than a U.S. quarter.\\n\"For anyone who skips over the title and description and goes straight to reviews, this is for you. These are generic figures, not the real deal. They come completely disassembled (legs need to be built, arms need to be inserted into the body) and you will undoubtedly break a few legs building them due to the poor quality plastic.<br /><br />If you want a handful crappy knock-off figures for a low price, look no further.\"\\nThe packaging is pretty awful and the opposite end popped off and more then half a container spilled onto the ground cracked and was completely a waste for the few I was Ted for my kids to try. Also they crack open pretty easily while trying to move them into bracket form about fifteen cracked at our block party that went already ruined.\\nthis is the biggest piece of junk I\\'ve ever bought in my life it does absolutely nothing but take up space it is a waste it is supposed to stick together like a frisbee with suction cups on the inside and then turn into a ball once it is caught the inside never sticks together the suction cups just don\\'t work it is frustrating because it just keeps popping open and becoming a half ball have frisbee it is a frustrating piece of garbage do not waste your time no matter how good the commercial looks this item I\\'m surprised ever made it to the marketplace\\n\"This is ridiculous,it is SO tiny and cheap,I was embarrassed when it arrived,it only has a couple darts too..if your child has a lot of toys and you want to avoid clutter of useless items then don\\'t purchase this.\"\\nI ordered this one brand new and the side of the box was cracked on the paint and the back top portion was ripped more than half way off cutting through the jokers portrait on the back\\nthis is listed as a 12 piece set when i received it it was just one i would have never paid over 9.00 for just one mini figure.i think the description is very misleading.will never order again am very dissatisfied.\\n\"Only had Chroma Drone for 2 full hours of flight time.  Perfectly calibrated my drone, powered on and got a successful Wi-Fi pairing.  Never could pair the camera as it said it needed an SD card.  I had both a 16G SD card in the controller, and a 32G SD card in the camera.  This afternoon after I synced the drone to the controller, I lifted off, and brought 10 feet into the air and it held it\\'s GPS position when I took hands off controller.<br /><br />Moments later I flew it 100 yards maximum from me, and 200 feet of altitude.  The manual states it has a range of 600 yards.  I was no where close to being near the range of this unit.  The camera on the controller locked up, the Wi-Fi connection disconnected, and the drone started flying off!  I hit the &#34;HOME&#34; button on the controller but the Wi-Fi could not be re-established.  I did everything according to the manufacturer\\'s guidelines and my $ 1,500.00 investment flew away and I could not follow it or retrieve it.  This unit has serious flaws and I will continue to post and re-post until Horizon Hobby compensates or replaces my unit with a working unit!  Very disappointing!

It\\'s as if I had ordered a pizza, and the restaurant delivered a cold pita with some cheese-in-can smeared on it. That\\'s how disappointing this paint is.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Weak color<br />- Takes forever to dry<br />- Impossible to layer<br /><br />This stuff is runny. I feel like I\\'ve encountered thicker water than this paint. I\\'ve used Mehron paints before--ones that I\\'ve bought from a specialty costume shop--and they\\'ve had a much thicker consistency that dries easily with a smooth, matte finish.<br /><br />I thought, \\\\\\\\\"\"Ok, this stuff is weak, so I\\'ll just apply more.\\\\\\\\\"\" Surprise! You can\\'t layer it! I tried applying it multiple ways--with fingers, brush, sponge, with primer, without primer--nothing worked. The paint is so runny that the first layer barely tinged my skin purple, and attempting to add more caused the paint to streak and clump, no matter how carefully it was applied. It seriously looked like I had smeared blueberries on my face.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Didn\\'t stain anything (probably because it was too watery)<br />- Didn\\'t stink<br />- Seriously, that\\'s all it had going for it<br /><br />I brought this bootleg-level MEH-ron paint from Yagoozon; Amazon Prime fulfilled the order. I don\\'t know if Mehron changed their formula in the last five years, but if they haven\\'t, you\\'d do well to avoid putting this wet garbage juice on your face.\"\\nDid not work and most the balloons had holes\\n\"I took forever to track shipping information, when I received it, I notice it was a stick-on and some of the sticker was peeling off. After the first initial wash (hand wash) most sides peeled off and was not usable after that.\"\\nIt broke before I could even get it out of the plastic bag.\\nNo cape\\n\"Does not hold air ,  came with hole in it , and no patch kit , very dissapointed\"\\n\"I didn\\'t pay attention to the size of the balloon, but the seller did not list that these were latex balloons. They do not hold helium very long, and were on the floor by the time my birthday party started. An embarrassment and waste of money.\"\\nWay too thin and tend to fall and reveal your hands.\\nBroke after a few minutes of use....very disappointed\\nAwful.\\nThere was a hole in the one we got :-(\\nVery small!\\nIt doesn\\'t fly.....\\n\"its plastic , not advertise correctly , when you say mat, mean something made out of fabric and thick not like a table clothes\"\\nWas not what we expected at all.  Works alright but the lego looking part is just a sticker. And clearly not a Lego-made product.\\nAm very upset box was crushed and ripped especially since it was supposed to be for a gift and it item was Supposed to be new\\nSoooo disappointed with this!!! Had it for 1 day and the pin broke off the mocking jay. Super glued it back on and it was good for another 2 weeks before it broke again... I was so bummed. My husband broke a bigger pin and super glued it onto the mockingjay so I could wear it again... We\\'ll see how long it lasts before it breaks... Again... And then I\\'ll be trying to find one from somewhere else\\nThe paddles work but the ball doesn\\'t work at all. We use the paddles with a different ball.\\n\"I bought 2 of these for my 7 month old and 21 month old because they had the best reviews on Amazon.  I hate to say it, but I didn\\'t have a good experience with them.  My children were slipping out of them, so I tightened the straps, which then made them too tight and constricting up top.  Maybe I just didn\\'t have a good experience.  Holding on to them since I waited too long to return and threw out the boxes already....hoping that we have better luck next season.\"\\n\"would not recommend. it only worked for one day. also, it said buy one get one free- I only received one. it took forever to arrive!\"\\n\"Please change the picture to reflect the item sold. After we ordered the costume, my 4 year old asked 5 times a day every day to look at the picture. He was so excited to wear this costume. When it arrived with no beard or wig, he was heartbroken. Turns out the beard was the main draw for him.\"\\n\"Made of plastic and the plastic knobs popped off the part that you screw into the drawer in less than a week.  Don\\'t waste your money. Out of the 10 I bought 3 months ago only 3 still are holding up however, they are only for decoration and aren\\'t actually on a drawer or being used for any purpose. I\\'m afraid if I touch them, they\\'ll pop off too. Very cheap, and know I know why.\"\\nNot good enough\\ni think this toy would give my kid a complex. wierd\\n\"Not the best board, slight tile causes the pieces to slip.\"\\ndo not buy it again\\n\"Too hard, actually impossible so we put it back in box and my hubby is a good puzzle builder. Sad that I won\\'t have it to hang.\"\\nVery very unsatisfied with this product !!!! Not at all what iexpected from the description . Very cheap dollar store quality .I workstation have even bought from a dollar store. Made of plastic and cardbord . Waste of money !!!!!\\nWhen mygrandaon received it he was so excited but then when they tried to close the zipper on the backpack it would not close. The zipper was broken on the backpack. So he is only using the lunch box. That was just the first day he received it. Low quality product.  I had to order him a different Super Mario backpack.\\n\"I bought these understanding they may be kind of cheap, but that was an understatement!  Not only are the sooooo small that they won\\'t go even close to resting on the ears, but the &#34;lenses&#34; are a plastic film that doesn\\'t stay on.  I would have had more fun with the money I spent on this product by flushing it down the toilet.  At least this way I could have watched the different George Washingtons race around in a circle and I could cheer on the winner.  The time it takes the toilet to flush is longer than the enjoyment I felt when opening this package.  I tried to even take something away from this product and placed them on my dog one sunny day when we were outside, but I had to quickly remove them as the other dogs started pointing and laughing due to how cheap it made us look, and I\\'ve been trying to console her ever since.  She is afraid to even go outside now for fear of further humiliation.  So not only are these glasses cheap and a waste of money, but they also will humiliate your animals.  For shame Dazzling Toys, for shame!\"\\nCRAP! Don\\'t waste your money!\\nCame from China and were poor quality.  Had a very strong chemical smell when I opened the package.  Will not be giving them to my grandson.\\n\"The product is cheaply made. The pieces don\\'t hold well together. They fall apart easily.  I really wanted to toss all the pieces in the garbage but I didn\\'t want to disappoint my son.  I usually buy Lego, and after trying this product I will Only buy Lego.\"\\nThe floats did not last and popped few hours after using they sent me two more and those lasted like 15 min the seats detached them selves I threw them all away and will probably now get charged for all four since they sent me two more and wanted me to returned them which was implossible since I was not gonna travel with pieces of popped floaties\\nI paid the extra money to get the bunch of balloons after reading the ratings and Intead got magic balloons. My packaging and balloons didn\\'t look like the items listed and had a different name on them. Out of 100 balloons maybe 10 of them worked and stayed closed.\\nThe batteries run in it but no bubbles come out. Plus the plastic top was cracked and broken when it came. It doesn\\'t appear to be what is making it not work but who knows. All I know is my kid now has a broken toy.\\nVery poor construction<br />Led lights don\\'t all work<br />Several switches for led light inop\\n\"Garbage. Do not buy this item. The fuzz was coming out when I opened the package, Cookie Monster has bald spots on his feet and arm, plus the seams are unfinished. I have a hard time believing this is an authentic Sesame Street product.\"\\nnot what I expected at all.  I saw one another kid had and said this was what she ordered.. it wasn\\'t but it was a gift so no time to send back.. not worth the $$$$$. small and rough.\\nNot happy...received battery but battery is no good...dead as can be.\\nnot good wasted half of the balloons\\nbasically unusable.\\nWouldn\\'t buy is Harley Quinn figure. I bought it and went I open the box both arms were broke off before I got it out of the box.\\n\"I had one of these as a kid so I was excited to get one for my kids and one as a gift.  Once I received it, it was clear this item is made with the lowest quality plastic and cord. While showing two 5 year olds how to use it, we zoomed back and forth but then the orange cord went through the handle, flew back and broke the skin on my arm!  Please don\\'t waste your money or worse, have a child get injured. Do not buy!\"\\n\"ended up ripping on a seam on the blue bottom around where it was plastic stitched so I know it was a manufacture issue,  missed the open window of opportunity to replace it ripped 2 days after that.  it was sad I was looking forward to keeping this for seasons to come probably get a hard pool next time\"\\nThey r to small medium u would think they would b like 2&#34; x 4&#34; stickers they should b labeled small\\n\"Misleading item made in India, Should have used it to look into future, way to small and quality lacking, lens were diffulcult to see through. Requested return label upon arrival and inspection.\"\\n\"Swan arrived with a small hole that slowly leaked air. We tried to patch it and it lasted for about at day. The swam popped the day of the party and deflated in the pool. For the amount spent on this and the fact that it only lasted ONE day, I feel extremely ripped off. There were no notes that there was a small leak under the wing before this was purchased.\"\\nboring\\n\"This thing was a disaster.  Flimsy cardboard, fell apart in a month.  My son was so excited to get it, and he was crushed when it came apart.\"\\nToo expensive.\\nA little disappointed\\nOne of the corners broke and couldn\\'t fit back in the second day.\\n\"They smell. They are pretty thin. I haven\\'t used them yet but, the strings look like they will break super easy because they are so thin. I wish I could have found some at wal-mart because I wanted better ones than these.\"\\nI hate it because I order this for my Father for his birthday. I typed a very beautiful note to go along with. I drove everyone\\'s attention to him opening his gift. I said wait til he reads his card. THERE WAS NO CARD. How embarrassing .... I have always received cards for other gifts from the other places. What the hey.  Will never ever order from this place again. This was a game I used to play with by dad when I was young wonderful memories. Now upsetting memories... boo who\\n\"Just crap, surprised it didn\\'t electrocute my kids\"\\n\"Absolutely AWFUL!  Soooo cheap, yarn hanging out EVERYWHERE! No real form and doesn\\'t sit right. Total waste of money!\"\\nNot all of the balloons filled up and the topper would not attach properly attach to the faucet.\\nThe first one arrived all moldy with some sort of white powder on the cards. The cards are also all stuck together. The replacement was the same way and I have to return it. Hopefully third time will be the charm because if the calendar was not damaged it would be awesome.\\n\"The light saber is pretty fragile and broke right away. However, the kids did enjoy it while it lasted.\"\\nThis item was ordered for my Grandson\\'s Birthday under Kathy Cowan\\'s name. I am Jan Whitley and I ordered this product early to make sure my grandson got it on time. He has talked and talked about a morphibian  rover. Well he opened it today. I put brand new batteries in it and it worked in the house for maybe 5 min. Since I ordered early I can\\'t return it. I am very very disappointed in this product!!!!\\nGood game for grandkids\\n\"one out of four did not work!  Wires are too short and no tech info.  All together returnable garbage as usual from neewer.Amazon should drop them as a seller, they are nothing but bad news. Every product i have ordered from them is trash. Quad frames, motors, ESCs , propellers etc. And AMAZON DEALS THIS TRASH TO T\\\\VALUED CUSTOMERS!\"\\nThis pool lounge chair was impossible to put together and I returned it.\\n\"Quality of the product is cheap cheap. Returned it prior to opening the package. Specs are nice, only with the quality of plastic was good.\"\\n\"My son and I have had three Hobbyzone RC airplanes before this one that were well designed.  We bought the RTF model.  This airplane is poor. The front landing gear is fragile and will break as other reviewers have noted.  Ours broke on the second flight.  It is not an easy repair, I think the whole fuselage has to be disassembled to repair, have not been able to fix it yet.<br />The bottom line:  Don\\'t buy this airplane.\"\\nNot a good buy!! The product is flimsy and breaks easily. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The seller gave me a hard time I asked them to replace my broken glow stick bad customer service.\\n\"Well, I picked this up as a gift for my 3 1/2 year old son. I thought it was pretty cool, but here is his review:<br />Him - &#34;Papa, I don\\'t like it.&#34;<br />Me - &#34;Really??&#34; (I\\'m totally incredulous now) &#34;Should I take it back?&#34;<br />Him - &#34;Yeah take it back. It\\'s not very good&#34;<br />So there you have it.\"\\n$80? Are you kidding me? Savages.\\nSize medium was too small for an 8 year old.\\nDidn\\'t work properly. Motor was broken.\\nIt came in a crushed box with one part attached outside the box of the legos.  I\\'m afraid to open it for fear it might be unusable.  VERY disappointed !\\n\"We loved the 1st version, but this one is too damn complicated to be any good. Swing and a miss on the creators. I know they were trying to create more depth to the game, but I feel like they did an injustice to the original.Seriously, our friends wanted to quit after 10 minutes and they play ALL of our ridiculous games.\"\\n\"I ordered 4 of these rafts- 3 of them were fine, but one of them had a huge hole punctured in it and had obviously been used and returned by someone else! The card board rings were missing out of the cup holders , there was dirt all over it, and the tie together rope was missing ! I realized this as we opened them to float down the river and had to go purchase another tube from the store at the campground !\"\\nThey don\\'t mention that this only works as an add on for an entire gym\\n\"It\\'s missing half the game. It wouldn\\'t even let me post the first review (not sure why). We bought it for our Teen Area in a public library, and the kids can\\'t even play the game. It\\'s missing the bases for the pieces, the search cards, all 10 dice, and the scorepad. Pretty frustrated, and so are the kids.\"\\nWe received a defective set of Ninja Turtles.  One of the turtles was missing and one of them was a duplicate.\\nWe purchased this and we were very excited to put it out but it only worked for about 3weeks. Very disappointed.\\n\"The Stroller is adorable and my daughter could not wait to play with it! However, the front axel rod was too long to fit and there was no customer support number anywhere to be called!\"\\n\"The whole point is to see the football in the dark right? However, it only lights up when it senses impact - i.e. at release, at catch, or during a good spiral (i.e. by someone old enough to throw it in a spiral every time). If it doesn\\'t light up at the throw, you cannot see it to catch it. Which is the whole point - playing football at night. Great ball for kids (not hard etc.) but doesn\\'t stay lit. Will keep looking, for something that lights up with a on/off switch if possible.\"\\ngARBAGE!\\nI would have paid $10.00 max for this non quality product!\\n\"I am writing to share a serious matter of importance as it relates to one of your children’s costumes.  I refer to your Gone Mental children’s costume, with the description that reads, “He has crazy thoughts in his head. He\\'s GONE MENTAL. This pullover tunic features faux vinyl straightjacket straps with buckles detailing, blood splatters, and mental ward screen print. You\\'d be crazy not to get one!”<br />My younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child.  We’ve taken her to UCLA and Stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness.  If you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a children’s/adolescent’s mental health treatment facility, I assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.<br />Childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a Halloween costume.  And neither is adulthood suffering (note that you sell several other adult costumes that stigmatize and inappropriately portray the mentally ill).<br />Vampires are not real.  Mummies come-to-life, monsters and zombies are not real.  Cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real.  Those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for Halloween.  But childhood and adolescent mental illness  very real.  I doubt you would sell a Stage Four Cancer costume.  Why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?<br />Stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.  Please reconsider stigmatizing our daughter’s very real illness by removing “Gone Mental” and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.\"\\nTHE ITEM WAS TOO SMALL AND HARD TO ASSEMBLE. IT WAS NOT WHAY I ANTICIPATED OR EXPECTED.\\nWhat I recieved is not a Lego product.  This is a crime.\\nThis product was received in a timely manner but when I opened it and looked it over there was a mark on the Mickey Mouse face like a red marker or something but it was a fault in the design. So now it looks like Mickey has a red thing coming out of his nose.\\n\"They sent a different pattern(which was also ok), not the one shown in the picture....Zip broke after couple of months into school - had to use another bag for rest of the year....Not a good choice\"\\nThis was nothing like I thought it would be.  After reading other reviews I expected it to be more than it was.  Very disappointed.\\n\"AWFUL! I was so excited because of the reviews on this but I\\'m extremely disappointed. EVERY DAY (sometimes multiple times a day) I have to restick one or both suction cups back on the wall (up for over a week now). It doesn\\'t matter if the surface is wet or dry, nothing works to keep it hanging for more than a day. Don\\'t waste your money\"\\nI was unable to inflate it since itt came with a hole.\\n\"I would have returned it once I inflated it, but it wasn\\'t accepted. POS won\\'t stay inflated. Cot it up for the trash man.\"\\nThe quality of this product is equivalent to something you would use on a birthday cake decoration. Within a few minutes the wheels fell off one of the cars and could pose a risk to a small child.\\n\"It was awful.  The first one looked used with the left leg dangling from the pinata and the opening taped shut.  The replacement was a bit better.  We went to hang it up so the strings could be pulled and all the the strings fell off.  We then had to secure it for pounding by the bat.  It took over 30 blows before we were able to break it because it was not designed to be hit,  Finally, an adult gave it 2 big wacks and the kids descended on the goodies below.  They did not know how bad it was, but I sure did.  The box the original one came it was way too big and had brown paper (3 crumbled up pieces) to protect it in shipping.\"\\nNone of the rubberbands worked. All the water leaked out before my sons could even play with them.\\nMessy toy that doesn\\'t work. Returning.\\nSupposed to be low odor but still smelled terrible\\nThese clubs are really cheap. The plastic is super hard and uncomfortable when catching. The stickers were poorly applied and the black edging tape is black electrical tape that was coming off. I\\'m a little suspect of the previous ratings.\\n\"This was my second attempt to get this product. First one was really bad, the animal stickers were all wrinkled and just look awful!!!  This one the packaging was taped to the stickers in a few spots and ripped off parts of the stickers!!!  nice idea of a toy but looks horrible.\"\\nThe material looks cheap and not true to size\\nSo upset. Bought as a gift and the box was completely squished.\\nBad quality in dresses and shoes.  Discarded them.  Came from international purchase.\\n\"Purchased in June, only used once or twice and now is losing air, would not purchase it again.\"\\n\"Not real looking. Not flexible. Colors not right.  Will be returning it.  And, for almost $25!  No way.\"\\nHorrible product. The bristles were broken on delivery. And the total length was only 33 inches and not 45 inches as advertised. It is basically a short bamboo pole with a bunch of sticks twist tied to it.\\n\"This product was shipped in a plastic bag which caused the original shape of the mask to get distorted mostly in the mouth area. I had to place metal pieces inside of the mouth to bring it back and keep it in its original shape. The mask also has a really strong paint smell as if it had just been freshly spray painted and i couldn\\'t wear it for longer than a few seconds because of how strong the smell was. I tried returning it and my refund was approved but I still had to pay for shipping so i decided not to waste any more money on it. The horse also doesn\\'t seem to have a jaw or cheeks, its mostly just a very wide neck and then the mouth. The patch of hair on it is also coming off and I haven\\'t even used it, it looks like it wasn\\'t sown on with much care but i guess for the price of 10$ you cant expect much quality. Mask was very poorly made.\"\\nLeaks air.\\nLooks terrible! Donatello is tan not green like the rest of turtles. I would have returned but forgot and then it was too late. Became a very expensive sandbox toy.\\nnot even one balloon sealed all garbage\\nbattery and charger were defective.  too much troubling trying to send stuff back and forth.  would not recommend this item to anyone\\nHorrible out of the entire order only 2 actually sprayed water -- ther were returned and I had to give back money -- HORRIBLR Experience\\nThese swimmers tear easily and are a danger to children. One tore off while my son was in the pool. Good thing i NEVER leave him unattended while in the pool. I just put him on the ladder safely.\\nWas only a few cards. Son was disappointed.  Be sure you know how many cards are in this pack before buying.\\nReally tiny. Would not go well with my costume this year I\\'m 5\\'9.\\n\"Knife blade broke after 2 weeks, just pulled out of green covering, very cheap\"\\n\"The power analyzer was a dud upon arrival. None of the wattage, amp, or other power readouts work. Only the voltage readout works. The seller offered to replace the unit if I ship it back to China. It\\'s not worth the cost of the additional shipping, nor do I have time to wait several weeks for the replacement.\"\\n\"I spent an immense amount of time on this puzzle only to find that many pieces are missing. Also, I\\'ve found some areas that are shifted incorrectly and thus impossible to connect. I\\'m very disappointed that I wasted my time. Hopefully Ravensubrger will give me a refund or replacement, although I have no intention of re-starting this puzzle, or any other Ravensuburger puzzle.\"\\nI was extremely disappointed in this product. I bought two of them to go with  costumes for my nephews.  The string was so thin that it broke within ten minutes. The string also came out of the hole. All in all a waste of money.\\nPiece of crap. Didn\\'t move smoothly. My son could care less about it. Looked cheap too\\nI usually don\\'t like to leave bad reviews but this time it is well deserved! I ordered this product believing that I was getting what was shown in the picture and description! That wasn\\'t the case! The product wasn\\'t a exclusive Funko Pop: Vision from the Avengers 2 movie! I was the regular version! A Rule of thumb if you are going to advertise and describe a product on here... Be honest and tell actually what the product is! On a positive the product was delivered really fast and the condition was perfect! But next time just be honest and say what the product is!\\nSeriously? 450 dollars for a gun worth 30?\\n\"This was worthless! The underside is hollow so the only inflated part is the crust. Got holes quickly, literally after not even a full day of use. The material isn\\'t think enough. Too bad we tossed the box or this would surely have gone back.\"\\nTerribly difficult to clean. Broke after 2 months. I use it as a decoration now.\\nbetter to just pay the extra to get a name brand one. this one broke within 1 day.\\n\"Poor design, battery pops up when scewing on cover. Not waterproof\"\\n\"bearing hardly spins. It has surface rust all over it, and if I take it out and spin it on a pencil or bearing too, it maybe spins once around, if that.  Pretty much useless as delivered.<br /><br />I got a replacement, and the 2nd one also has rust on the bearing, and the bearing is garbage.  If I could give this less stars I would. Fool me twice? Well, I\\'m taking a refund from this.  If you want a responsive metal yoyo under~$40, save your money and go get a Drifter instead.\"\\nDon\\'t buy! The entire box of glow necklaces would not light up! I had a party full of sad kids!\\nBad quality\\nItem broke after only a few uses.\\nLasted 30min before ripping. Boys 2 and 3 yrs old .Dont waste your $$$\\nawful toy....broke after one hour of use..........dont  waste your money.\\n\"These toys are most definitely fake! Lets take a look at the seller\\'s\\' description of the item: &#34;The Style is Random,Maybe will repeat styles.Because We have lot of Style , so maybe you will get them not show in the picture .because they are loose , so maybe will have some scratch .hope you can understand .&#34; In case it wasn\\'t obvious enough, this is some of the most broken english that I have read in a long while. In case that wasn\\'t a warning sign then let me turn your attention to the picture of the product that\\'s displayed on this page. That too is fake! You can pull up the same picture and hundred of others on google just by typing in &#34;littlest pet shop toys&#34;.  When I first recieved the package for my daughter she was elated to finally get her Littlest Pet Shops. Let me tell you; these where probably made in a Littlest Sweat Shop! When I opened up the package there were 2 tube sock esque things. Not the bag that was pictured in the product page  I opened one and out poured the shoddily made pets. I picked one up and examined it. The HASBRO toys logo was nowhere to be found on them. The paint job on these things is horrible. So bad that it might be considered an act of animal cruelty. The paint looks like it dripped down the body while it was drying and stayed that way. If that wasn\\'t bad enough, the pets have Spongebob Squarepants disease! The seller did not mold the plastic correctly and as such the plastic hardened in between the legs, making it look like a square cube!  Another thing that I noticed was that you have to be very careful about touching these things. One small scuff of the nail easily chips away the dodgy paint job.  To quote the seller yet again, &#34;The Style is Random,Maybe will repeat styles.Because We have lot of Style&#34;.  They do indeed have &#34;lot of Style&#34; because in the two bags that I received where the SAME EXACT ITEMS IN THE OTHER BAG! I got two bags of the same thing!  The worst thing of all? The seller doesnot want to refund my purchase! He says he wants me to keep it and he\\'ll give me back $15 dollars of the $35.98 I spent on this worthless pile of trash. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE OTHER REVIEWS! YOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT WASTING YOUR MONEY HERE LIKE I DID.\"\\nthe chocolate does not come out of easy squeezer and my daughter was very disapointed that she could not make any chocolate\\n\"Erasers were packed where parts were bent and easily broken. Also the parts did not fit together well, like the Iwako erasers.  However, Shipping and Returns were no issue at all.\"\\nWe did not receive the EX or full art as promised in the description.

Cute Toys~ but smaller than I imagined for sandbox toys.\\nI got charged but never record my product and tried many times to call with no answer\\nI agree with the other buyer named Nikki . Not worth the money ! It`s a disposable toy! to think that you have to shuffle it everytime you play . I`m thinking to return it but I don\\'t want pay the shipping fee back .\\nterrible details. the face specially.\\nWaste of money!!\\n\"Awful product. All it is is a sheet of green felt and a large diameter poster tube. I would be fine with that if It actually did the job, but it DOES NOT. The puzzle pieces do not stay in place and you can feel them coming detached from each other and shifting as you roll. I only went up halfway and could feel the pieces moving so I unrolled the half I rolled and my daughter and I had to spend 15 minutes putting everything back in place.\"\\n\"Bought this for my niece and nephew and they had problems with it.<br />Attached to a hose, the water pressure didn\\'t seem high enough to wet the entire slide. They had ZERO use out of it.\"\\nThe picture shown on the website when selecting and purchasing is different from what I have received - Olaf had a mouth closed but the plush I have has a partially opened mouth. It\\'s ugly.\\n\"I was searching for &#34;3 year old girl toys&#34; and this is what came up along with age appropriate items. This product should be removed! What if kids come across this?! Amazon, you are dropping the ball here.\"\\nThis item is cheap but a waste of money. My advice is to just buy a more expensive one. When it shipped in I realized that there are 100 sheets of paper but only 2 have bens face on it.\\nHad a horrible experience with this...\\n\"Well, the filled pretty well but do not break when thrown.  The children who played today all left bruised.  After about 5 minutes we just stomped them.

Junk... Just got mine today and thing is very poorly made. No screws for landing or guards , think there supposed to just clip on. Nope they don\\'t stay. Charger is a European plug in. No on or off switch for copter. Missing a cover for a light. The only thing good about this is it will look good sitting in the corner.\"\\nOnly received 1 microphone in my shipment instead of the 12. Very disappointed!\\nThis was a terrible purchase. The ball leaked right out of the package. Couldn\\'t even inflate it the first time.<br />Do not buy!!!!!\\nThis is not same what shown in picture and what i received. The quality of product is very poor. No proper finishing. The paint over the characters are not properly done. Disappointed with the quality.\\nHorrible quality\\n\"Truly awful toy. Horrible electronic noise which scares baby and the song sang unrecognizable language. Song not complete. Ends on &quot;duck&quot;, then repeats again same words about duck but the sound is (awful noise) reminding of frog..then it abruptly ends.<br />Absolutely awful buy.<br />Huge disappointment.<br />For the price could be so much better interpretation and quality!<br />WARNING: they don\\'t accept returns (WHY???)\"\\n\"Well, our Max came with two left feet.  Literally.  And since you cant attach one of the left feet to the right leg because it doesn\\'t fit, our Max looks a little more &#34;special&#34; than fierce.<br /><br />Which is unfortunate because problem #2 is that Max doesn\\'t fit back in the box.  So Max (or Special Max, if yours comes like ours) gets to ornament a shelf in your home.  I\\'m sure there\\'s no chance little kids will lose all of his tiny little pieces since they\\'re unboxed, right?<br /><br />So we pulled Special Max from his bookshelf home to play on Family Night, and did our best not to joke too much about his unfortunate condition.  To play, there is a ladybug-lever at Max\\'s base that you pull, which causes him to spin around and land on a &#34;random&#34; spot (parents and astute children will quickly find the pattern).  If there is a game piece there, it is removed from the game.  Pull Max\\'s arms back up to reset him and you\\'re on your way.<br /><br />Things were going well for about 8 minutes, until my 5yo pulled the ladybug-lever back and it broke, rendering the game useless.

It broke on first use.   A waste of $.\\nTotal waste of money\\nI purchased this slide for my grandson.  It was the most frustrating thing I have ever put together.  Took hours for 2-3 of us to put together...The holes don\\'t line up and some bolts are not long enough.  I had to buy longer ones to put the last piece on.  He loves the slide but I would never buy another one of these\\nThe wig was very small for a 5 year old the end of the braid was pressed in the package that it stuck out and would not lay straight.  The hair itself was not long enough at the top to stay in the braid.  Child and adult was Very disappointed.\\n\"This target exclusive set of transformers is not great quality. I bought it for my sons birthday and returned it in favor of buying the transformers separately. These are cheaply made, difficult to transform, and will easily break.\"\\nPiece of junk. Some included bricks will fit into the holes/pegs of the mug and other included bricks will fit and are so loose just fall off of the mug.\\n\"I am so incredibly disappointed in this purchase.  I have purchased balloons many times as I am a professional balloon artist.  Whenever I purchase balloons they come in bags of 100.  This comes in a bag of 10.  It is listed, but I didn\\'t notice it.  I wasn\\'t looking for it, because WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE WANT JUST 10?  So receiving this bag was very upsetting to me.

They also are tropical, coming from rice paddies in Thailand. So, they need a water heater. They also require at least 2.5 gallons of free swimming space, due to having &#34;brethrin&#34; in the large rice paddies. This is basically a death trap for a betta, or most likely any other fish. DO NOT BUY!\"\\nDies not work\\nWe received 3 of the same unknow character. Not very happy\\n\"IF YOUR KIDS HAVE LONG HAIR, DO NOT BUY THESE!  Both my daughters were having &#34;Bunchems wars&#34; and I had to cut their hair to get these out.  They are like little balls with fish hooks on the ends!  They are in the garbage.\"\\nWhat!?!? Eighty bucks for this thing?\\nMy kid with sensitive skin broke out in a rash.\\nOr you could buy the two items individually for (as of this writing) $7.71 for the plush and $19.10 for the copter set and not get robbed.\\nI found the directions very difficult to follow. I would not recommend this product to anyone.\\nPieces were warped.  I sent it back.\\nI am not satisfied at all with this product.  Bought it for my grandson\\'s 3rd birthday.  We aired up the tires to the correct pressure and when we walked away we heard two loud pops!  Both tires busted.  When bought the replacement tubes that was recommended the tires rub and he is unable to ride the trike.  Also all of the metal has rusted in just a few short months!\\nNot happy at all. Does absolutely nothing to protect the phone. Cosmetic purposes only.\\n\\'The dress is beautiful.  The veil fell apart as soon as I took it out of the package.\\nTruly disappointing<br />I ordered this for my 8 year old who has been begging for it for several months. When i gave it to her she was excited but after a few hours it kept shutting down. We had to keep opening up the battery compartment and resetting it every day. After 3 days of doing that she and i got sick of it and just put it aside. She has not tried to play with it since then. A total waste of money!\\nProduct was not functional on arrival. I replaced batteries and it still did not work.\\nDidn\\'t fit leap pad.\\n\"Not sure if this is a review on the actual product, but the picture shows a different smock, with 3 pockets on the front, and I received (2) 24+ Months sized smocks with no pockets. They are for small children. Wrong item, falsely advertised.\"\\nMy 2.5 month old grabbed the sock rattle and it tore off.... Clearly poorly made.\\nDid not work at all as described.  We ended up with 50 kids waiting for water balloons and all we got was a cooler full of water and flat balloons.  Will not recommend or order again.\\n\"What.a disappointing product!  The instructions were pretty bad. Nothing like Lego.  My four year old who helps with Lego brand couldn\\'t help with these instructions.  That aside it was missing a part of the roof and the man\\'s leg falls off continuously.  My son just wants to put the man in side with the boxes and you have to take the whole top off to do so.  These blocks have many deflects and they were difficult to snap together- also the construction isn\\'t thought through as I am used to with Lego brand.  So while assembling, often other parts are falling off.  One star because it is still played with but never would I buy this brand again.\"\\nExtremely small item\\n\"it is exactly like the picture, 10 squares (not single line beads as I thought) Not a product for me. Quality is great.\"\\nCute but not as vibrant as the picture shows. I bought it to match my grand daughters back pack. The one I was mailed is a pale pink (faded looking) it does not match.\\n\"Not only the pieces are pretty small, but also, my son had his heart set on the pack that contains the Gorgosaurus in it. Well, they sent the one without it. Since you can\\'t choose here from the options, even if you order two you may get the same set without the one you want! I can\\'t reorder because I may get the same set! Anyway. My 6 yr. old son was very disappointed. IMHO, these type of non-optional sets should be picked up in store vs. ordered through mail unless you don\\'t mind what specific items you get. Caveat Emptor!\"\\nYou did not know which item was going to be shipped when you ordered it and it was not really clear that each order only included one of the four items\\n\"Opened the first 5&#34; test tube touchable bubbles and the bubbles popped like ordinary bubbles.<br />Needless to say, we were very disappointed.  Looking carefully at the label it was made in<br />China.  The ones that worked best were from Japan.  We will be asking for a refund.\"\\nReceived this and it looks nothing like the picture. It is smooshed and misshapen and just down right ugly.\\n\"I should have heeded the warnings from other customers who received dented lamps. I ordered two, and each had at least five dents in them. The shades are very thin/fragile, almost paper-like. I don\\'t think it will help to order replacements. They\\'re getting returned.\"\\n\"I had to wait to give this to my grandchildren when they came to visit, had to by an air pump, then when I got it all blown up it had holes in the seems I  tried to return it but it has been past the 30 days. It isn\\'t Amazon, it was the company, I also bought an inflatable mattress from them that didn\\'t last long at all. the seems broke and I had a big bubble bed. that could be slept on as the bubble was right in the middle. Intex has bad quality products. I tried to contact the company but never heard back.\"\\n\"This SUCKS do not buy. I have been doing magic for a while and I got this today looked fine opened it once for practice and it was broken, they will not refund, DO NOT BUY!!!!\"\\n\"Very disappointed! This picture misleaded me about its actual size. This is a very poor and super tiny paper cut product.  Believe me, when I say super tiny, it is as small as an US Quarter after you assemble it.  The seller should indicate its actual dimensions and material.  The scale 1/150 description is just too vague!  I wouldn\\'t have bought it if I knew its this small and made by paper...  Not a good product at all.\"\\nThis device started out great but recently I noticed a portion of the screen is not responding to touch. Don\\'t know what to do. I really don\\'t want to return it.\\n\"It\\'s one of my worst nightmares to have a toy my child loves but can\\'t work himself.  I literally lost days of my life to this toy as my son tried and failed again and again to transform it properly.  I don\\'t know why the design is so flawed, but I would recommend just about any other transformer to this one.  Truly a frustrating experience.\"\\n\"2 of 5 lights didn\\'t work...another 21$ to buy batteries. Go to fill them...another 6$. Within an hour, with temp at 80 f, balloons wouldn\\'t float w helium. I was pissed from the chores and money wasted.\"\\nWaste of money.no box.not as pictured.looks lame.\\n\"Im very disappointed in the product! The legs and attachments only snap in, they are not screwed in. The table top spinner only sits on a piece of raised plastic, it doesn\\'t even snap in! It\\'s a matter of days before the pieces go missing with a toddler. The legs are not sturdy and does not offer a sturdy base. If I had not already assembled the table I would return it back.<br /><br />(The only assembly requiring screws is the handle for the caurosel and the two sides of the tunnel)\"\\nBad. One eye doesn\\'t lite up and motion sensor is not working consistently. Not good. Waste of money.\\n\"The description of the item clearly said MATERIAL: GLASS. Once the order was placed i checked my confirmation and the title changed to say acrylic dragonballs. Acrylic is not glass, That is false advertising and that is illegal.\"\\nAbsolutely terrible. The product was broken upon shipment.\\nit doesn\\'t look like the picture. fake.\\nThis keychain was a gift for my granddaughter who is eleven.  The sticker was stuck right on the fur instead of plastic wrap. The chain and key ring were cheap and one of the eyes came off with minimal use.  Only had the keychain less than a week.  Definitely not worth the money!!  Looks like a carnival trinket.\\n\"Disappointed in how weak the attachment of this bracelet is. The charms attach well, the bracelet to remain on your kids arm, not so much. We have had this one day and my son was putting on his backpack and it came off. Debating returning it, wife may not let me and the price vs shipping ay be ineffective\"\\n\"When I received this, the face was broken on one of the clocks.  I returned it to the seller and they sent me another one.  The second was no better.  One clock functioned ok, but the other would not keep time properly and would not start running properly when the button was pressed down.  This looks nice in the pictures, but if you want something that functions properly go with a digital clock.\"\\n\"Piece of junk, wasted money,if you hit the rim with the ball it would fall over.kids couldn\\'t,t enjoy  it.\"\\nDoes NOT fit standard sized dolls as some have said. Waaaaaaay small. I went and purchased newborn sized cloth diaper covers that are made for real newborn infants and those fit perfect for dolls!!\\nTotal crap.Did not work!\\nCheap chinese made. Rotten wires inside that were disconnected after the first fall.<br />It worked exactly 20 minutes after I opened it. Garbage .\\n\"I ordered this for my husband and I gave it to him for his birthday and it has never worked, we have ordered more batteries, we have charged them we have done everything we can think of and it still will not work.\"\\n\"The Cloud Pet is very misleading. My husband and I have  Droid Phones and the App is not compatible with them. It is unfortunate as my husband travels a lot for work and was looking forward to sending messages to our 6 year old daughter. Our son has an i phone and the App is compatible with it. But as it turns out, it does not not allow you to send messages from far away like it leads you to believe on the commercial.\"\\n\"i ordered this gift for my kids to play with them but after a few days of them playing with it, one of anna\\'s hair piggy tails fall off.\"\\nI didn\\'t realize how beaten up it was\\nPieces were so small and flimsy hard for toddler to get pieces in and out\\n\"Totally sucks, gave it several months try. Needs longer life\"\\n\"There are no instructions on the box for ensambling, in most parts it is severly mistreated.\"\\nBroke the first time my daughter put it on\\nthese are 45.00 from the factory and 20.00 for the knock offs.\\n\"Okay so let me start by saying, my son and I love paw paw patrol.., okay, but this toy here he priced way to high I bought it being stupid.... It only says phrases it should at least have other options especially for that price, it\\'s jus a stupid toy , I\\'m going to put it up with my sons collection though because I don\\'t want my money to go to waste!!! Parents please don\\'t buy this... It\\'s a waste of money!!!\"\\nHorrible too small for 3 year old! Returned.\\nThere was a split in one of the seams.\\nThese are horrible. Do not buy them. The dye that they used to make them colorful bled on my hands and they broke so easily. I do not recommend these. Especially in a classroom. I had to replace about 8 or 9 a day that broke.\\nWhen you crank the wheel the entire structure shakes causing the marbles to fall or stop rolling.  The conveyor belt is poorly designed and does not drop the marbles back into the structure unless you crank the wheel extremely fast which causes the entire structure to shake and break.  The instruction manual makes Ikea manuals look easy to follow.\\nDoes really work. Don\\'t buy\\n\"Item is not as pictured, and much smaller than stated. Not sure if the description is wrong, or if the wrong item was sent as the patch was sent alone with no packaging whatsoever. I got a flimsy, tiny patch and the red embroidery is not outlined in black like shown.\"\\n\"Like others have expressed, this is not a quality product. Think Dollar Store. It would make a nice decoration in a kid\\'s room, but I wouldn\\'t let thrm play with it. There are bits of flaking glue everywhere. We were missing a wheel (see photo). And it looks like others could fall off at any second. It\\'s also smaller than I expected, and the box looked rough when it arrived. I had planned to give it as a gift but now my 7 year old is playing with it.\"\\nNot happy with this product. The tape would not rip and it was just not easy to use and flimsy.\\n$14 for a twelve inch circle... Not worth it picture shows other tracks\\nThis is the WORST product ever! It was fun at the time but messy at the end. It\\'s super  slippery and super dangerous! I used 20 towels and 4 bath mats for this mess! It can get in your areas and it\\'s hard to get off! It made me slip and fall and twist my  ankle And I\\'m in a boot for 5 weeks! You should never by this for you kids it also stains your bathtub! The devolving  powder dose NOT work it was a waist of time and didn\\'t even work that well! It\\'s a waist of time and money don\\'t get it it will ruin your bathroom and can make you get hurt it\\'s not fun!\\nNot happy with these at all. The paint doesn\\'t come off and if you use more water it just puts a hole in the paper.\\nNot worth it!\\n\"the product was not sealed the 7 figures that were in the bag were all around the box.  it clearly states 25 miniature figures, and i only have 7! this is a big disappointment.\"\\n\"Boat worked for one day, hasn\\'t worked since. Very fragile\"\\nwhat is in the bucket? how many of what parts\\nhard to assemble\\n\"First tumbler arrived and everything worked fine for about 8 hours - then the piston stopped turning, though the motor was still running.  Could not get it to work.  Amazon promptly sent a replacement, which arrived today and this one does not work right out of the box.  Runs for about 2 minutes then the barrel starts jumping all over and the machine seems to get stuck.  Also noted that on both machines only 1 of the pistons actually turned when the motor was on.  The other always remained stationary?  Not sure I am willing to give this brand another try.......I have to get something since I now have all of the grit and filler supplies as well as pounds of rocks to tumble.  What a disappointment!! Would not recommend.\"\\nBroke the minute it was unpacked\\n\"Chinese fake. Comes without box, manual, etc. And breaks in one minute. Crap!\"\\nWould give zero stars if I could.  The cube came with a tear on one side.  The tear is nearly 6 inches long and just can\\'t be patched.  I wish I would have returned for a refund but the kids were so excited when it finally got here that they just made the best out of it.  Can\\'t climb in it or on it like the pictures because of the deflated side but the kids are making the best out it.\\n\"Quality is terrible on these.  I was expecting a fit and finish as good or better than Funko\\'s POP! Line of figures, but instead got something that looks like it was painted by a careless high-schooler. Very disappointing.\"\\nExtremely small\\n\"Initially my son really liked this Kendama.  But now, after a few uses, the plastic rubber rings keep falling out, so my son is disappointed in this Kendama.  He doesn\\'t really use it any more because of this.\"\\nNot worth the 10 dollars i spemt not gold plated just plastic that will chip off the first time you touch it.\\nIm sure if i would have received my locker it would have worked as expected.  But since i never got it i will just slam it.\\nThe package I received only had 3 fans in it. I am supposed to have 18!!!!!

I\\'ve never seen a real girl who looks like this .She doesn\\'t have the natural curves that real females have. Some of Ken\\'s clothes fit her.  Her head is too small. She looks more like a guy than a girl. She needs at least a little glam. There\\'s nothing wrong with liking glam unless it\\'s overdone. I prefer ribbons and lace and the right amount of make-up.\\nDidn\\'t receive.  Package arrived with contents missing- bag was torn.\\nNo need for the blinking lights. Really a bad creative decision for design. Almost a good product ... unfortunate\\nOne of the jousting sticks came deflated. Very disappointed by this.\\nVery poorly made.

For the $ I paid, I don\\'t expect to be my own manufacturer.  What a cheap piece of junk!  There is no real help online from this company, either.

What I received is the 2015 Asia Re-issue.<br /><br />The 2012 model shown on this page is produced by Hasbro exclusively for Toysrus and deserves this price (you can see the round silver TRU sticker on the bottom corner of the box).<br /><br />The 2015 Asia Re-issue, though also produced by Hasbro, is made in Vietnam and can be found for much cheaper elsewhere.\"\\nWas not the right doll\\n\"They were much much smaller thank expected, not adult size as stated.\"\\nThe toy came in a white bag tape and the box was folded up and ripped\\n\"What the heck!

The latch on this lunch box came off suddenly on the first day of school while we were dropping her off in the morning. I personally opened the box to get her afternoon snack out to put it where the teacher instructed, and when I went to latch the box back up... The latch was no where to be found. It had fallen off and was layout my on the floor. Tried to get it back on while there but could not. I\\'m sure if we had taken it home and used some tools on it we could have gotten it to go back on... But it fell off... The first day... We little strain being placed on it... Shouldn\\'t have to need tools to fix it... So anyway, we let the teacher know it was broke so she could help our daughter with it if needed. Then the next two days we found a pretty ribbon to tie around it until we could replace it.... And then yesterday! ... After school.. I was fixing her lunch for today and the handle came off... Again. With little strain being placed on it.... Just not good quality. Could understand if we had been banging it around, shaking it, and hitting the ground with it, lol... But definitely won\\'t be buying lunch boxes any more. Will be sticking with lunch bags.\"\\nDissatisfied with this purchase.  Items extremely small.  No dolls available for purchase to fit items.\\nFlew for about ten minutes. Made a soft landing and now it will not fly. Have had many others and never had this issue. Very disappointed.\\n\"Well I got a bad one, about two flights the copter land on the floor and then continues to go crazy and good luck turning it off when when blades are in full motion.  Waste of money, doesn\\'t work and I\\'m a big RC guy!\"\\nReally disappointed in the quality of this doll. My 3.5 year old was excited to receive this doll as a reward and when she opened the box the first thing she said was &#34;where is her cape?&#34; There is no cape.  The entire top half of the outfit is pained on to the doll so there is no playing dress up with taking off and putting on the dress.  The hair is not in a braid like the Elsa character in a movie so basically its a blonde barbie with a plastic snowman. My daughter is thankful and plays with her doll nevertheless.\\n\"I\\'m very disappointed in this purchase. I had already let my son start playing with it when I noticed small pin holes right off the bat or I would have returned it. The material is poor quality, Very flimsy and hurts to crawl through. I\\'m glad my sister had one from 10 years ago (my nephews) and still in much greater shape than this new one. Don\\'t recommend wasting your money.\"\\n\"Filled with air, put in pool and it bubbled like crazy from a hole. I can\\'t get to the hole to patch.

The elastic was super thin, flimsy, and sized to only fit an infant\\'s head. Even when I replace the elastic, I still couldn\\'t use the eye-patch because the plastic part was so small it didn\\'t cover the eye well. I wish I could have returned this product instead of just throwing it away.\"\\nTerrible product. DOA\\nBroke within a day.\\n\"Very, very cheaply made. Came with a bent axel (or what I would equate to an axel on a car) and a broken connector wire to the battery pack. Despite this I fixed the wire and tried to run it and it has a 2 second lag between when you move the controls and when the truck moves, even at 2 feet away. Also not powerful at all. I love many products made in China and I work for a company who manufactures in China but I would call this a very &#34;Chinese&#34; toy. Meaning it came from a factory that cheapened everything to get cost down yet it is still as much as a quality version. I got another at Toys R Us made by New Bright RC for $20 more and it runs fantastic. Worth the extra money if you want the biggest scale.\"\\nCheap.. Horrible product. The blue polls won\\'t stay in the brackets. The net won\\'t fit across the pool.\\nExtremely small.\\nThe suckers were all broken when they arrived.\\n\"Very cute key covers. Unfortunately, they didn\\'t fit our house keys. They were snug fitting, which we THOUGHT was a good thing. Only to find out 2 days later the key covers (both) had split. I wouldn\\'t have even noticed if my husband hadn\\'t noticed it first. It might work for smaller keys though.\"\\n\"Oh god this thing feels absolutely horrible. I guess it\\'s sewn together well, but the sound it makes when you touch the thing hurts my teeth, it\\'s in no way a soft drawstring bag. If it wasn\\'t 9 bucks I would send it back but whatever.\"\\nI ordered one and it was broken/defective so I returned it and ordered a replacement.  The second one was even worse!!

Also sometimes it doesn\\'t stop growling - terrifying for little kids.  I had to put it outside until it stopped an hour later!\"\\n\"Broken, the little wires that connect it came apart.  He was very cute while he lasted, unfortunately he did not last long.  RIP little dancing monkey.\"\\nThe information says that &#34;now you can rotate the board.&#34;  That is why I purchased this one for $27.97 instead of a tile lock version that was $12.01.

It is hard to distinguish between black and &#34;white&#34; squares. It really distracts from the game.<br /><br />The white checkers have inconsistent colors - much more different than expected due to variations in wood grain. It looks like staining of the pieces was not done consistently.\\nThese noodles started developing defects after being used for a few weeks.

I let them air dry for 2 days and i washed each one by hand with vinegar and the smell and feel of them lingered.  I would definitely not buy if you are planning on blowing them up.

Unfortunately, because I had ordered them at the end of July and his birthday was in late Aug, we couldn\\'t return the crappy defective tank when he opened them on Aug 24. Literally one day outside of the return window. These would have been a fabulous gift if the parts would have arrived in good working condition. You\\'ll have better results and &#34;wow factor&#34; by taking out a $20 bill and lighting it on fire in front of your children.\"\\n\"This item arrived without all its pieces, but that only affected the bubble capability. When we tried to make it fly, it simply sat there. About 45 seconds went by and suddenly, ZOOM, it shot up in the air, ignoring all subsequent commands, and once it made it about 40 feet in the air it shut off and fell to the grass. Each flight was a variation of this-- it doesn\\'t initially launch at all, but if you are very patient and repeat the same &#34;up&#34; joystick command fifty times, eventually it will take off. It then would fly straight up without responding to any other controls, cut off high in the air, and tumble to earth. For something designed to fly around and occasionally fall to earth, it is incredibly cheaply made. Three flights in and the fuselage cracked and the tail rotor flew off somewhere in the grass and was lost. I guess that\\'s why they included an extra rotor, but if they are lost that easily one extra will not last long. Two other plastic pieces also came off almost immediately. The instructions are horribly written and essentially incomprehensible, and none of the buttons on the remote are well-explained. There is a &#34;Demo&#34; button that apparently does nothing at all from what we can tell. There are &#34;speed&#34; buttons and an &#34;ABC&#34; selector that are equally as mysterious, as they appear to have no function in flight. I would recommend against buying this particular helicopter because the quality is really really poor. We received it as a gift from a well-meaning uncle, but unfortunately it simply doesn\\'t work and stands no chance of lasting long if it did.\"\\nTerrible taste\\n\"Fiends is a great game, but this is a ridiculous price for a toy.\"\\n\"I ordered the fuchsia set of waddlers, but instead received one YELLOW rubber duck with what I assume is a pacifier in it\\'s mouth.\"\\nBottom of box was crushed!!!\\nThese are tough to use and we left ours out a day covered on a deck and both of them the pullback string broke and now they are unusable and we have only had them a few months.

Even the foil part of the costume was turning silver. There are so much threading coming out everywhere and the one from Party City does not have any threading coming out. Even the photo of the girl in the costume comes as one of those bootleg prints. The belt that comes with the Party City is so much better and the shoes are shapped so much better. The cape also detached from the original. I should have just ordered this costume again from Party City. So disappointed and will be returning!\"\\nI am disappointed it broke the second day my grandson had it. He is 13 and was excited to fly it.\\n\"The battery came looking very melted on the edges.

I did it once, blew it up, and it wouldn\\'t pop back up. So I\\'m trying again. I\\'ve been letting the sand dry out, but that takes quite a while.

I used to love this game as a kid, and the quality now is horrible.  I would rather pay more for a better game.

An older batter that was stored with the new one had not been charged in a year or so yet it did have the energy to lift off, so it\\'s not the helicopter.<br /><br />I just sent a note to the seller to see if there is something I did wrong, however, I am thinking not. If there is some defect in this particular battery and he replaces it, I will gladly change my rating. Additionally, I am open to suggestions. For now, I put it back on the charger and will see if I leave it there longer than the charger indicates it should be, helps it. Sure can\\'t hurt it.\"\\nGuess i need to read more .

I would not recommend this product!\\nMy niece did not like these at all.  There where too small and not enough room to hold anything.  Not worth the money or time.  I would not recommend this product.  Don\\'t waste you  time!\\n\"So, this thing is super cute however there are a couple flaws.  One I see as a serious  flaw.  The little bell on the front of the duck fits very well into my son\\'s mouth.  He liked to chew on it.  There also is a bungey kinda string which ties the bell to the duck.  It\\'s stretchy.  I noticed that my son was wearing through the string and that eventually the bell was going to come off.  Since the bell fits into his mouth this would obviously be a problem with a serious chocking hazard.  I STRONGLY urge the manufacturer to consider this issue.  I immediately cut the bell off.<br />On a lesser note...it\\'s kinda tough to get the wheels to turn.  The little flappy feet make it hard to turn when you push it.  It won\\'t work at all on our hard wood floors and is a bit of a pain on the carpet.  Like I said...it\\'s cute...but it has it\\'s flaws.  I wouldn\\'t order it again if given the choice but I won\\'t be returning it.\"\\nJunk!\\n\"Purchased this item because I had the product pictured for years and years, very great quality heavy pewter keychain, and it finally gave out.

Junk.\\n\"I bought this for myself as spirit week was approaching at work and one of the days was &#34;Bling Bling Day&#34; It is not made for adult\\'s mouths. It was very small and did not fit into my mouth (which my dentist regularly tells me is small). It also came looking like it was opened and did not contain a packet of beads to melt like the instructions state. There were already melted and placed into the trough where your teeth will go.

So, when I saw it last November on amazon I purchased it for my granddaughter\\'s birthday that was this past March. I did not know that Leap Frog only has a 3 month warranty  on their products as that is not in the description on the products. So even before I gave the gift it was out of warranty. Well, as luck would have it I received a product that was a lemon. It only did one of the three things it was supposed to do. When I contacted Leap Frog, looking to see if they could fix or exchange it, I  was asked numerous questions over and over again every day for 6 days. They did not tell me it was not under warranty until the last email even though on my first email I told them my purchase date. I am unhappy with their product as well as their personnel that obviously wasted my time and really did not read the information he was asking me for. Very disappointed.\"\\n\"The Pack came with out some pieces.flower, on tree Red and Mecaw\"\\nVery small compared to picture.\\nvery poor quality toys\\nIt was hard to put together.

The interior rim is not attached to the mesh in several places...like the machine just skipped the seaming in several places. In other words this one defective and shoddily put together. It is a great idea but really need to go back to the drawing board on how to make shade stay up. The two little Velcro straps are woefully inadequate. I don\\'t have the box, but I am still going to try to return. $28 is a lot to pay for a floating water ring.\"\\n\"I blame myself for not reading more carefully.

Sounded good...sadly impractical.\"\\nThe holes for the lacing on the brim are clearly burned in. The picture hides the fact that the lacing is not attached. It is tied into a messy knot and hangs off the back of the hat... like NO cowboy hat ever! Flimsy and nearly too small for a toddler to wear.

One was for my son & one a gift for his best friends b-day. My son is 14 & bought one with his own money. My son started to fly his drone as soon as it got here. He had a great time flying it until the second day. On the second day the battery wouldn\\'t get a good connection nor would the battery lid stay closed & the camera completely stopped working. So we just thought it was a default on just one drone. Then 3 weeks later ( because best friend lives out of town) when he was able to see his best friend to give him his drone for his birthday, he also got a short lived camera & on the 3rd day his ended up not working. So I guess in all the boys had a fun time with it for a couple of days.

After contacting this company about a horrible product, they want me to pay for return shipping to China in order to get my refund.  I don\\'t mind returning it to them, but at my cost when this thing is extremely unpleasant/noxious.

DO NOT BUY !\"\\n\"The manufacturing is so awful that none of the holes align properly for the screws to go in, making it literally impossible to put together without going to see a carpenter and getting new holes drilled. This is the second product ive bought from hape with manufacturing problems (the drum set i bought had a leg without holes drilled in for the screws). Have lost faith in this company. Would never buy or recommend their products again.\"\\nDid not get the blanket. But my daughter loves the bear\\nVery disappointed.  My kid just saw these beetles in Japan and he is disappointed to find that these figures are about 1/2 the size of real beetles.  Not worth the five dollar plus price tag I paid for these.\\n\"I\\'ve had these stools in my classroom (not purchased from this seller, but the same stools) for 3 years, and they have NOT been durable or stable.  The screws on the legs regularly loosen just from normal wiggling and shifting weight when seated on the stool.  I have to tighten them at least once a week.  In addition, the screw holes strip after enough tightenings.  I\\'ve drilled new holes, used putty, and done pretty much everything I can possibly do to extend the life of these stools, but they are going in the dumpster today.  Terrible design. Not worth the money AT ALL!\"\\nHorrible!  Exploded after 1 day of playing.\\nI ordered a pink one but blue showed up my daughter played with this I think for maybe five minutes.

You can say I was disappointed when I got it.\"\\n\"Unless you are a current or former drug addict or criminal, it was difficult to relate to the cards.  I am all for answering uncomfortable questions or being crude, but when you can not connect to the game at all, it just isn\\'t that much fun.

She was very excited, especially since it was pink.  But it doesn\\'t work, and I\\'m returning it.  Quarters always register as nickels.  Nickels register as pennies or sometimes dimes.

After I got this bow I was really really shocked. I rate this a 1/5 because in the picture it shows the bow string as a leather or some sort of material, but when the item came. The bow string was plastic and cheap. Not to mention the arrows. The tips came off every time and there were no feathers at the end. It also did not have a little gap in the arrows where you can fit it in the bow. Basically, my money sent to the trash c: thanks useless product.\"\\nSucks\\nOpened box after 30 days and the tube instantly started to deflate. Unable to return to Amazon as result.

Unfortunately we received two identical cars.  I figured that was ok since we could always paint one with model paint. Problem is that one controller, controls both cars. This means that we can only run one car at a time.\"\\n\"The mug arrived after a couple of weeks.  It was a black mug.  There was a paper inside the mug with the picture on it.  There were no English instructions about transferring the photo to the mug.  It was all in either Japanese or Chinese characters.  Very disappointing for such an expensive mug!  I am awaiting a response from the seller.  Update:  the seller responded that the mug is completely black until hot liquid is poured into the mug.  The picture then slowly appears and also slowly disappears as the mug cools.  I tried this.  It took very hot liquid for the picture to appear.  I bought this for my 6 year old grandson who loves Hero 6.  He does not drink hot liquids, so for now, I guess this will just be a magic thing to amaze him.  The paper picture that came inside the mug was to show what the picture would be when the mug contained hot liquid.

They take the fez (which is supposed to be a boxy hat) and they shove the whole thing into a box folded up.

The whole thing feels like a wabbly piece of material rather than a solid, box hat like a fez should be.<br /><br />The image shows a solid hat. What comes in the package is a folded up piece of frabric. You ruined the hat the moment you sent it out the door.

While Hasbro promised to send a different  game to replace it (not Mashing Max because it was out of stock), it looked to be a design flaw.  Also, this is one of those annoying games that does not fit back into the box after you put it together -  so there is no good way to store it without assembling and disassembling every time you play.\"\\n\"My grandson was so excited and was playing with it and it\\'s head came off can not be fixed, the first day he rec it.

My boat came with two propellers and two replacement propellers.  Three of the four cracked on the motor stem after their first use.  So unfortunately my boat only had three successful rides before it was laid to rest!  Disappointed.\\nVery small and not real looking at all.\\nDid not help at all with my dog training\\n\"It arrived on time, but had a hole in it.

Very disappointing.\\nJust received these and I cannot be more displeased.  The box was completely crushed and shows signs of leaking!  All of this had to have happened PRIOR to shipping as everything else in the box was completely UNHARMED!<br /><br />Don\\'t bother wasting your money!\\n\"Didn\\'t work, had to return it.\"\\n\"This is the second one of these tried out -- a replacement for an unsatisfactory first one -- they both simply don\\'t have the suction force necessary to meet their advertising. Impossible to capture even very small, slow-flying insects nor most perched on vegetation. I would return except that I missed the return date by two days.\"\\nExpensive!!!!!!!! horrible! No sale !!\\n\"My son received this for his third birthday and I was so excited to have it for longer trips in the car. Turns out I feel horrible for the family member that spent money on this because the markers don\\'t show up at all. They smell horrible and have a strong odor but just leave behind a barely tinted wetness where it\\'s supposed to be &#34;color&#34;. Absolutely useless. What a fail, Crayola!\"\\nIt was way smaller than expected :(\\nWasn\\'t the right size...I ask for a trailer to fit pergo battery operated tractor....too much of a hassle to return...\\nShould\\'ve listened to the other reviewers. Thing sinks half the time and is just boring. Our 1 year old isn\\'t at all interested in it.\\n\"These are the worst sunglasses ever! They are very poorly made. Do not ever stay on a child. The lenses pop out all the time. They are junk! The animal print kid sunglasses for sale here are much much better. My 3 year old daughter got those at a birthday party over a year ago and has worn them a ton and they are still fine. She just has been clamoring for a blue pair and we didn\\'t want to get an expensive pair we would be upset to lose, and I assumed they would be a similar quality to similar bags of multiple plastic kid glasses but they aren\\'t made well enough to stay on a kid\\'s ears. Do not buy these unless you want very frustrated and disappointed kids.\"\\nWas not Lego product but advertised as such\\n\"Very poor Quality!  It\\' wont stay on the side of the tub at all.  Such a disappointment!<br />It is a nice idea for a &#34;cool Toy&#34;, but it lacks key components to make it work properly!\"\\nDOLLAR STORE GARBAGE QUALITY DONT BUY!!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  TOTAL RIPOFF!!!\\nNot one of these worked. Zero. Water seeped out of them all.  Bought this product from a different company before..and those worked great. These were total rip off and my sons seventh birthday party happened without water balloons\\n\"What a P.O.S.!!!!  Rather than  explain the details, as to why I am returning the airplane  just know that this product is (in my &#34;non novice&#34; opinion); is priced entirely too high.  It is not user friendly and appears to be cheaply put together... difficult to use and not worth the money!  One of the reviewers on amazon stated &#34;panic mode my ass,&#34; when referencing part of the plane\\'s operational &#34;simplicity.  I NOW agree with that particular critic.  Save your money.  Buyer beware.\"\\nIt was supposed to be Blue/Black...it was Green/Brown. Someone should seriously review the color wheel.\\nQuality poor\\nArm joint broken in package\\n\"ABSOLUTE CRAP!  DON\\'T BUY THESE and if your do, CANCEL IT BEFORE IT ARRIVES!!!<br />TOTAL RIP-OFF!.  If I wasn\\'t using them to give to children with Cancer, I too would have sent them back but Mickey and Friends is enough to keep these little troopers happy thru the Xray exam.<br />  Each ribbon has little micro stickers with about 20 1cm,2cm,3cm and a few 4cm stickers on them.  The tape that holds the ribbon in the packing then rips the stickers when trying to get to them.  Insulting to the buyer,.....WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!<br />(-)minus 10 STARTS\"\\n\"Horrible! The packaging says these are appropriate for as young as 12 months. My 14 month was able to get the crayon out of the holder and it became a choking hazard! Once it was out, it wouldn\\'t pop back in and stay in so I had to just toss them. Would never buy again. Definitely disappointed in Crayola.\"\\n\"Not a good quality, not what was pictured.\"\\nThe quality did not meet our needs at all.\\n\"balloons look old and and stained yellow , like old looking , and I don\\'t think they were worth what I paid for them. I was disappointed\"\\n\"Horrible, it\\'s  just one full charge, and after that  we can\\'t  charge again\"\\nVery disappointed because I order purple verified purple and received a red slinky.

Second one barely worked.\\nNo tiddlywinks were included on the package!\\n\"Great candle but didn\\'t play music as the box described.  Consequently, wasn\\'t happy with that.\"\\nI love this gadget; however it only worked once.\\nNot live caterpillars just empty cup\\n\"All the glue were dried out.

Gonna try to return it.\\nNever got a chance to try it out since it did not stay inflated--it must have had a hole from the beginning.\\nSent a completely different puzzle instead. &#34;Pebbles&#34;?<br />This was a gift to my Mom. Too complicated to return. It was sent directly to her. Disappointing.\\n\"You only get one for this price, shows 3 beware\"\\n\"It was great FOR 1 WEEK.  Then the one wheel would not turn.  I contacted  seller who advised me the issue was the user not  balancing the scooter. I have 2 of these scooters, I know how they work, this is not user error.  The scooter  is defective after 1 week of use. It was a blast the first week, my son and I would ride them all over the neighborhood! I found it very easy to use and I am not the most coordinated person. I would only recommend this if there was a better troubleshooting/help line to assist when issues arise. Very disappointing that I paid so much for a product that only last 1 week.\"\\nIt already broke.\\n\"I bought LDrago on 08-08-2015.as a gift for my grandson, who specifically asked for it. He has good experience. But on the second attempt,the launchers holding point broke and the blade had become useless. Not only have I lost money, it was agreed disappointment for my grandson.<br />Further, no other launcher can play LDrago . I requested for a replacement but no response. As can be seen, I am a regular customer for Amazon  and Amazon.in. There was no rough handling or launcher but a manufacturing defect. I sincerely hope the seller would replace the white  launcher for the above blade and Amazon should insist on that. Thank you.\"\\nIt\\'s cheaply made. The seams started to rip within one day.\\nPurchased for my grandsons  birth day gift he only played with it 5 minutes and the cab broke off\\nI was disappointed with the set because one doesn\\'t work at all and the other only sometimes even tho it is In full sun on my windowsill.  I did receive a credit for one half of my purchase but I would never order this again.  Very disappointed because I think they are cute.\\n\"Do not buy, cheap and flimsy and packaging and delivery was disappointing box was wrapped in tape and falling apart.\"\\nIt was broken when I got it....  very disappointed.  And it looks extremely cheap.\\n\"I received by Syma and was excited to test it out.  I\\'m not inexperienced with quadcopters.  I have a Hubsan and a VL Toys.  I turned on the Syma and everything seemed normal.  About 2 minutes into the flight, I took it up to about 20 ft altitude and it apparently lost communication with the transmitter for some reason.  The lights on the drone blinked and I had no control.  Instead of powering down, the quadcopter continued to rise and rise and rise.  Once it got high enough, the wind blew it into the woods, never to be found again.  :(  Not pleased.\"\\nJust what we wanted...arrived on time...thanks\\n\"Expensive receiver and doesn\\'t even support PPM.

My granddaughter thought that there would be more than one. Her words &#34;this sucks&#34; u got a star because she enjoyed opening the package.\\nI got 48 way cheaper looking gliders. Not what I paid for. The ones I got do not have print on the bottom of the wings or the tail.\\n\"It leaks out the bottom. I returned the first one, thinking it was just a defect, but the second one I got leaked as well! Disappointed. Now I have to lug another big box back to UPS and find a different water table. :(\"\\nItem broken after one use.\\n\"Boat instantly began taking on water. The water caused boat to sink litterally every 5 minutes, requiring me to shake the water out of two small holes (?!) Sorry to say, but this was a waste of money. The holes Mentioned were pre-drilled holes, with no indication or direction that they needed to be plugged or sealed prior to use, so either this was completely overlooked, or this is just a huge design flaw.<br />Perhaps renaming the toy to &#34;Holy Submarine&#34; would be more appropriate.\"\\nCrap!!! All we got was crappy little &#34;charms.&#34; Total waste of money!\\nDropped once broke\\nThe design does not make good bubbles. This product frustrated me.\\n\"this seems like a good deal, then you get the packs. As you\\'re excited you open one by one seeing all the shiny, hopefully awesome, cards you\\'ve just obtained for a great price.

(Long hair of course.)\\n\"I thought this might be cute, silly, and kind of fun...it was so lame I threw it away.\"\\nThese things are far too fragile. Unfortunately unless you go with a custom carbon fiber design you are stuck with these.

This bag doesn\\'t even stand up by itself because there is no bottom! It is perfectly flat, all you can do is tape it to a wall for decoration. To top it off they charged me the full price when it said it was an add on for a buck.  Very disappointed, I usually have better luck with amazon products.\"\\nEvery crayon was broken & out of the box when they arrived\\nThey broke\\nMy poor 6 year old little boy spent 3.5 hours putting this together just to find out the whole other leg of the figure was missing.\\n\"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Product is very hard to get off of skin! The girls also said it was very itchy. It says remove tattoo with facial cleanser or wipe; it does not work! I tried wipes, washcloth, soap, hot water soak, lotion, and makeup remover. It took three 9 year olds over 40 minutes to get their tattoos off. Finally had them rub makeup remover on liberally and wait for 15 minutes. It finally came off. They are now dealing with red, raw areas above and below the eyes.\"\\n\"F*CKING GARBAGE!

Ordered justice League,  got simpsons.\"\\n\"Buyers beware.  I looked on youtube about this exact product, but thought there was no way it could be wrong being it was on Amazon.  There\\'s a little sticker on the back side that you need to look for, this makes it authentic.  It\\'s definitely not on this one.  No point in going any further with the comments, it broke within 2 months.\"\\n\"If you\\'re going for the Hunter S Thompson look from \\'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\' you should know there is no circle in between the lens. Also,  these glasses are super uncomfortable. In place of arms there are stretchy metal coils that wrap around your ear and dig into the back of it. It\\'s so bad I hardly ever wear them.\"\\n\"Two attempts so far, and I haven\\'t gotten the right product...\"\\n\"It\\'s cute but not worth what I paid for it. The headband would pull the crown flat against my 2yr olds head and there was no way to anchor or fasten it too her hair.<br />We had it less than 5 days and the crown snapped off rendering this product useless and I was unable to glue it back on because of the tension of the headband portion. oh well, lessons learned.\"\\nThis is an awful 3D printed lens cap.

Since I\\'m bothered to return it and get it again I taped the ripped part and just keeping it.\\nThe top to get to the bubbles is very hard to open and we had to use scissors. Then the wand is so little that even my classes little hands could not get it out and most of them ended up dumping all the bubbles out just to get to the wand. I recommended they take it home and have their parents use tweezers to pull the wand out.\\nSuper disappointed. I own most of the other sets and I love them. These showed up with horrible paint jobs. I love my other sets but this set had issues with almost every animal.\\nNot sure if we just got a lemon or not but my sons cube fell apart in about a week.  He was so excited to get the 2x2.  I felt so bad when it broke on him.  Beware.  I watched him play with it and I do not think he did anything out of the ordinary while using the cube to make it fall apart like it did.\\n\"Maybe we had a defective ball, but this one popped within 20 seconds!\"\\n\"The color on the mask is brown. I ended up taping it off and spray painting it to red b/c it was so off. The costume snags and gets pulls from the smallest piece of the velcro touching it and I still haven\\'t figure out a way to keep the shell from falling off. I got it for $9 and I\\'m glad for that b/c if I spent $20 on it, I\\'d be pretty mad. My son loves it and wasn\\'t even phased by the brown mask, but it really bugged me so I\\'m posting a picture.\"\\nMy daughter loved it but it was made of cheap material and she had it on less than 10 minutes and it broke off and is permanently lost.  Definitely not worth waiting a month for and not worth the cost of shipping.\\n\"DIDN\\'T HOLD UP WELL AT ALL.  KIDS LOVED IT WHILE IT LASTED.

I ended up not being able to insert the batteries. I was worried my baby might swallow those undependable screws, so I threw the toy away.\"\\nI could not get it to work properly.

Couldn\\'t even be bothered to return it. We chalked this one up to experience.\\n\"This tent did not make it through one night. First of all, two people will not fit in this tent unless they are children under 4 ft tall. I\\'m 5\\'6&#34; and I could not stretch out in the tent. As I prepared for sleep at night, the insider zipper on one side simply broke, meaning the steel zipper itself broke, rendering it unusable. On the other side, the zipper kept jamming. I had to sleep with the front flap partially closed (photos attached).<br /><br />Wouldn\\'t recommend this tent at all.\"\\nthis is soooooooooo over priced i bought the same on off of amazon for $30.00 and the only difference is that this one comes with gloves  that i got at claries for 3 bucks do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!! even the one for 30.00 is horrible quality\\nHad one gear stripped when I purchase it\\n\"Rainbow is nothing like the images displayed. In a pitch dark room, we were able to get maybe 12-18 inches of rainbow an inch or two thick at a range of maybe 2 feet. Very disappointing for what we hoped for our 4-year old and what she had been most excited about for her birthday (before turning on and seeing what it actually does/doesn\\'t). Also, why not include an AC adapter?! Net: you probably want to find something else...\"\\nWe bought these items in April after I saw what I thought was a good deal and prepping for the river. One of the floats didnt make it past the initial inflate. It started to separate at the mesh seam. Since i ordered it too  in advance i can not return our replace.\\nWorthless and a waste of money.\\n\"I was  actually very disappointed apon receiving this &#34;stress&#34; toy. To me it seemed more like a toy that belonged in a crib, not to be used for stress. I wish that I did not get this toy because it broke the first day of use and I had to end up throwing it away anyway. Overall, I was very upset.\"\\n\"Not worth the money.  I did not realize everything was fake.

How can I order the assembled RQ400 model?\\nThey are not stickers do not purchase.  when you say sticker some part must be sticky yeah!\\nFlight times were drastically reduced after installation and batteries were very hot when removed. I went from about four minutes of flight to a flight of a little more than two minutes. I called Horizon Hobby and was told this is normal since there is a much larger current draw. I\\'ve switched back to the standard motor since I don\\'t like the reduced flying time. It\\'s been a  waste of money for me.\\n\"ordered Crayola, because I wanted quality. Got this Prang brand. Swicheroo much?? What the heck?\"\\nno wings in the box\\n\"My son bought this at a museum gift shop.  It looks like it could be fun and a good learning kit, but his came without the manual.  I contacted their support, but have heard nothing back, and the only manual they have online is a just a few sample pages.\"\\nDoes not fit with Bachmann track. A waste of good money.\\nHuge mess!! I got rid of this about 6 months ago because I was tired of picking up the magnets and I\\'m still finding them!\\nVery small and not well constructed\\n\"Multiple different areas to blow up. The valves are like those on a beach ball. Once blown up, which took over an hour, the set was fun. Not easy to deflate and store.Plus, after all that work, you are not likely to pull out on a moments notice. You do need the run the hose, which makes the water cold. Overall, not worth the money.\"\\n\"I bought this bag for my daughter\\'s first trip to the beach so she could carry her sand toys.  I thought she would love the backpack style as it would make it easy for her to carry the bag herself.  Her dad packed the toys for her, while we were standing in the hotel room, as we were getting ready for our first day on the beach.  He went to put the backpack on our daughter, and one of the straps completely tore off of the bag, making it pretty much useless as a backpack.  Terrible quality.  My daughter didn\\'t even get to use the backpack one time before it became trash.  I ended up carrying it for her for the remaining days of our trip since we needed a bag for her toys....after we got home, straight in the trash it went.  Waste of money.\"\\nNot worth the money. We own everything \\'Monster Jam\\' and I was really excited for something new but this was a disappointment. It is very flimsy and does not stay standing very well. If the arms would lock somehow it wouldn\\'t be so bad. We are going to get a piece of finished wood and screw the legs down and glue the pieces together. It\\'s the only solution we can find to make this toy functional.\\n\"total piece of s***, showed up broken, the only lights are red, there aren\\'t even rhinestones it\\'s just a whole painted different colors\"\\nFlimsy mushroom collapses easily does not stay upright. Have to constantly inflate in order for my kids to enjoy a day with this pool. Only used this pool 5 times...do not waste your time or money.\\n\"one of the worst doll qualities ever! Plus, the doll an the box were in a bad condition!!!\"\\n\"This is a defective product. And Home Decorators response to the problem was weak.<br />Within a month of receiving this stool, it developed a bad case of thick grey-black mold. I like the shape and look of the stool and so I washed it, then saturated it with an anti-mold solution, thoroughly brushed the solution into the fibers inside and out, rinsed and dried it, sprayed it again with the anti-mild solution and left it in the sun to thoroughly dry. This &#34;overkill&#34; approach took well over 3 hours. Now a couple of months later the mold is back, as bad as ever. So, I called customer service which invoked its 90 day return policy. I\\'m past the 90 days. She did give me a credit of $12 but that barely covers the shipping cost I paid to get the stool. Bad product. Bad service. Not happy.\"\\nReally cool looking figure that is colorful and pretty accurate to the movie. But I have some issues with it. First it is not very poseable. Second and this is very crucial and I am very surprised that the maker &#34;Tomy&#34; would allow this is that the top flame piece pops out. It is very cheaply glued on (personally it should have been bolted from the inside with molded in-place peg which secures in place by figure halves) this is a very bad design that can potentially be a safety choking hazard for small children that find the piece and then place in their mouths. Also some of these figures don\\'t work with play sets that cause them to light-up and contacting the company &#34;Tomy&#34; is very difficult when they give you the third degree with questions. And when you send them a video of the faulty action they still want more proof. Ultimately you are better off returning the figures where you purchased them from. Remember these flaws when purchasing.\\n\"Ordered this for my 12 year old son.  Got the size recommended by their sizing chart, but it was way too small.  Also has their logo &#34;Morphsuits&#34; in fairly large white lettering on the rear end making it totally useless for the costume we wanted.\"\\nI recently purchased model no. 595. I forgot my password. Following the instructions in the pamphlet it will not let me erase all of the information. I have repeated the procedure several times. It keeps asking for a pin. When I press and hold the erase key it puts an a and waits for additional pass code numbers<br />Request assistance.

The quadcopter broke beyond repair the first day we had it.  Flying it above grass, one less than soft landing later, one of the plastic arms supporting one of the blades cracked.  I returned it for a full refund from Amazon.\"\\nNot bendy or flexible at all.  Feels like wearing cardboard on your face.\\nGarbage.  I threw it out. Not what I expected.\\nThey may look great but they are garbage the tie rod is alright but the actual links are to long and they completely limit your flex\\nVery cute it arrived very quickly but very cheap it broke the first day I only had about 3 minutes and it fell from the magnet to the floor and broke the magnetic is so weak it will not even hold itself\\nSaid 1st edition received unlimited. Terrible. I did not pay nearly 50 bucks for a unlimited Denkko\\n\"Too flexible.  Can\\'t get smooth curves because it wants to collapse under it\\'s own weight, so cars just jump off the track.  Forget the loop-d-loop.  If you can make a surface with the curvatures you want to put underneath it (pillows, boxes, blocks etc) it works ok, but otherwise it was more frustrating to me and my 4 year old than it was worth.\"\\n\"The game that shipped was not &#34;Beat the Parents&#34; but rather &#34;Meet the Parents&#34;, where the questions asks the kids how they think their parents would answer. It is a completely different game and not nearly as fun, nor what I had wanted to get my niece. I am very disappointed the wrong game was shipped.\"\\nDIAMOND SWORD MISSING  INCOMPLETE ORDER\\nVERY POOR QUALITY - MADE TO LAST ABOUT 5 MINUTES - HORRIBLE PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY THIS\\n1 star because the rope pulled out of the metal grommet after a few light uses by grand kids. 5 stars for prompt customer service from mfg. who sent a replacement unit at no charge.\\n\"When the package arrived, the packaging was soaked and dissolved once it was taken out of the plastic wrapping. Out of the 24 bubbles, only 3 had the lids screwed on tight, the rest of the bubbles were half empty and leaking - labels on the bubbles were soapy and wet and all peeled off when touched gently..

I don\\'t have time to fiddle with it to get it just right, but then *don\\'t breathe!* because they will come loose.

But I have some issues with it. First it is not very poseable and cannot stand on her own and the ball doesn\\'t stay in-place like shown on pictures.

It sounds like an automatic machine gun and makes very violent comments; something like &#34;Fire! Fire! Load your weapon&#34;.

SO GETTING MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE! Would have liked to have known that it wasn\\'t a DURABLE hard cover, but the whole thing is like a cheap pad of notebook paper with fabric over it. It does NOT have Sequins as described but rather shiny metallic spot on the fabric. I don\\'t think it is going to last through the day, the binding on it is HORRIBLE, but it does have a unique locking design, too bad it only comes with one key, and the fabric is loose on the journal. I do NOT recommend this.\"\\n\"Awful product.  Doesn\\'t shut off, and when it does, it goes on by itself (even when not in water!)

The suction cup is poor quality and does not stick well to indoor surfaces. It includes &#34;removable targets&#34; which are actually only ordinary adhesive stickers, not vinyl peels, which could easily damage walls. This is more an outdoor glider toy, for which purpose it is very overpriced.\"\\nNot as shown in the picture. Hood is not attached. Neckline is not even hemmed.

Not even one of them worked, which is the same thing I got when I purchased them in the store, hence the online order of more. Wouldn\\'t recommend! Waste of money!!!\"\\n\"These dolls are described as 1:12 scale and they most certainly are NOT.  1:12 scale means one inch is equal to a foot.  The adult figures are three inches high, which would mean they would be three feet tall if they were real people. They are much too small to go with my daughter\\'s dollhouse.  I\\'m going to go ahead and keep them, because I can find something else to use them for, but if I had paid full price for them I would be livid.\"\\nQuality poor.\\njust don\\'t like it.\\nTail fell off the next day!!

The duck I bought and received IS as pictured, but it is not a Moutin Roty Cuddly Duck. Those products are made in France. This product was made in CHINA.

This is a knockoff. Extremely bad quality tea set toy.\\nOrdered the smiling version and got the original newborn girl. It soft and expression is just like a newborn baby. My 2 year old like it. The negative will be that the dolls head is curled up so the doll never lays flat. It\\'s awkward to hold down or up. Legs all joint up at the knees. I really like that it comes with more than one outfit. Overall I am not happy with this doll. Not worth the price\\n\"My 9 year old daughter had her heart set on a Garfield birthday cake. I bought this on Amazon and it is wildly overpriced. The only two components of this that are truly worthwhile on the cake are the plastic Garfield figurine and the Odie figurine - the trees, bushes and doghouse look as though they came from a random &#34;dog house&#34; and are certainly not Garfield themed. The house that is pictured is PAPER. It is not even 3-D. And what is up with the coffee cup? A pan of lasagna, yes.

Rather than  explain the details, as to why I am returning the airplane  just know that this product is (in my &#34;non novice&#34; opinion); is priced entirely too high.

It\\'s literally cheaper than dollar-store plastic.  When set on a table a light breath will move them about.  In addition it was shipping in a padded envelope instead of a box, so I have no idea how it arrived intact without breaking into a hundred pieces.  It\\'s a shame as the size and look of them are not bad, but they really aren\\'t usable and are the antithesis of durable.\"\\n\"I should have believed the other negative feedback regarding this!  I paid $11.50 for this piece of Hasbro junk!  It came with 16 white game pieces and stickers which must be affixed to them...there is also a plain white game board with little white pegs,  however, you must glue a very thin piece of cardboard with a picture of the Frozen characters to this white board.  After trying to glue the cardboard onto the plastic, all the edges popped back up and the glue came through the peg openings, leaving a messy residue on the top of the cardboard!  This was a mess!

The hat is a deformed mess, no matter how hard i try to mold it. The &#34;dreads&#34; are a couple of reddish strands poorly patched together. NOTHING deluxe about it. Requesting return for refund from seller.\"\\nI was expecting much more for the price paid. I feel like this is a scam. Cheap plastic. Flimsy stand. No quality what so ever. I was excited to get this product for a professional business to keep my camera clean. Its an expensive game. They had a great Idea. Executed poorly. An absolute waste of money. I also paid extra for quick shipping. Admittedly totally got scammed on this product purchase.\\nThis thing is garbage\\nThis was extremely expensive for being a very small water gun with a sticker that says &#34;Splatoon.&#34;  I returned it to the seller.\\nIt\\'s fake wouldn\\'t recommend.\\n\"Crap, should be in a dollar store. returned it\"\\n\"So IF you had Hungry Hungry Hippos from long ago you will whine, complain, get frustrated, say &#34;really?&#34; a few times and more.. You will realize how bad, cheap, things have gotten.  IF you\\'ve never had HHHippos then maybe your review will be better as you have nothing to compare it with.<br /><br />The other reviews in a nutshell<br /><br />-Yes it\\'s cheap, not the same quality that it was before.<br />-Hippo\\'s get stuck,<br />-Balls may get stuck in the neck of the hippo<br />-Balls long ago were heavier, these are very light.<br />-Make sure you have the cap off the ball holder on the bottom or it does not sit flat<br />-Ball Storage, Cover the hole on the front of the box when stored, otherwise the cap will come off and the balls will be lost through the big hole on the front of the box. (We used Packing Tape)<br />-+, you have to (can remove) the hippos and they sit on the board for storage.  I wish it was better built and you didn\\'t have to remove them, but on the other hand, at least they have it sit compact for storage.  I\\'d probably prefer the old style that you can\\'t remove and you could drop without lots of little pieces coming apart.  You CANNOT drop this version without hippo\\'s or hippo parts going flying.<br /><br />You would think they could make it cheaper yet better since it\\'s been around for 40 years.<br /><br />I gave it 1 STAR for several reasons.. Our kids like to play it AND I can\\'t give it 0 STARS.  I have seen the price range from $12 -$20, I would not pay $20 for this.  We paid about $12.<br /><br />Hasbro, really?<br /><br />Click the reviews you read that are &#34;Helpful?&#34; at the bottom.\"\\npackage was missing a connecter to the bottom had to use duct tape to make it work  very disapointing.  I was at my grandson birthday party and I show up with a gift that is missing a piece.\\nNever again\\n\"Comforter batting, when item is washed, bunches together inside, at top of comforter. Bottom half has no batting now.\"\\nTiny and not useful...more like tinsil size\\nNot worth the price. My grandaughter so disappointed.\\n\"Item does not look like the picture. The wheels are not red, but rather an uncharming black. The plastic insert with the lights painted on it is on yellow plastic. When you push down on the lights it lights up a solid boring yellow rather than multicolored. If the plastic was white the light would brighten the painted image.\"\\n\"First of all, this is extremely low end product. It should be 10 bucks. It definitely is not worth $50. Leaking everywhere and messing up on table and on floor. It makes just flat ice, not even close to dots. I do not recommand this product.\"\\nSuper cheap. Was broken when i recieved it\\nPretty useless...\\nVery cheaply made. Couldn\\'t get the box open without breaking it to put the lights in. It was very hard for my son to do himself and even with my help I struggled. My hand hurt after putting everything together. Then the cover wouldn\\'t stay on because one side was broken and it wouldn\\'t stay lit up. Very disappointed in this product.\\nweak power and plane cannot work with it\\nVery disappointed in materials used. Plastic on top of cheap light wood sticks. Uneven surfaces.\\nTHE FIN WAS NOT WORKING A FEW DAYS LATER AND TOLD THE SELLER HE SEND US A PART THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO INSTALL WE TOLD HIM TO REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER DRONE AND STILL NOTHING\\nMissing purse and necklace ripped out through the package.  Arrival too late to purchase a different item for a birthday party. Embarrassing to give to child.\\nArrived with a broken neck and arm even though it was in plastic..used super glue and called it good instead of dealing with a return. Not even mediocre quality.\\nWorst product ever! Balloons lost water immediately. Disappointed Grandkids big time.\\nGave as a gift.\\ncheap and cheezie\\n\"Hundreds of throws, never got it to return to us.\"\\nNot 12 x 12! Smaller than expected.  Not worth the price plus shipping.\\nAfter less than three months the inside rollers no longer spin. So it makes a clicking sound and that\\'s about it. Amazon won\\'t take it back and I can\\'t find any warranty info. I\\'d steer clear and find a more durable product.\\nThis product sucks the motors blew up after the second day of using both of them. I will never buy one again. Thank you for waisting 300$ of mine\\n\"This is not grey, it\\'s a dirty mix between grey and brown. The lining is brown, how weird is that! It is stiff and smells bad as well. Overall the worst purse I have ever bought online.I tried to return but even I am a Prime customer Amazon wanted 6.50 for return label. Will go in the box for Salvation Army donations.\"\\ncould not find instructions anywhere....hard to practice with no directions....\\n\"Shipping was awful, No packing material, every Adventure time toy has its box damaged or was damaged long before it was ever shipped.\"\\n\"So many flaws with this toy.  Mickey doesn\\'t fit well in either the car or the swing.  He sits very loosely in the car and falls right out if you try to &#34;drive&#34; the car.  My 2 year old gets SO frustrated with this.  In order to get them in the swing you have to angle his feet in first, something that a little kid doesn\\'t have the coordination to do (and most likely would not occur to them to do).  I also don\\'t understand why there\\'s a picnic and a swing with the garage.  Essentially all you can really do with this toy is put the car up and down on the lift which is not all that exciting even for a two-year-old.  Definitely not worth the price\"\\nAlready one of the motor stopped working one week I guess I got to go ahead and spend money and buy one 7.50 they got to make money right.😞\\nCannot get the remote to sync with the drone so unable to fly it\\n\"beware, this is not a universal size and its not adult - it fits my 10 year old, not the 13 yr old who we bought it for. read others comments - wish i had.\"\\nIts not worth it. Way too small. And they arrived open so i didnt even get what i paid for. I got like 50 out of 200.\\nVery hard to put on\\nbought these  what a waste and way too expensive for the quality\\n\"UPDATE: The car functioned very well for the first 1.5 years. No complaints there. HOWEVER the gears broke in the drive, so we went over to the manuf. website and ordered a new gear set. Thought &#34;no problem, easy to fix.&#34; However that is when the trouble started.<br /><br />First we could not place the order on their website. For some reason they show all the parts, but you can\\'t order directly. So we called and placed the order on 7/4/15. Waited 10 days, got nothing. Called and they said they were moving and lost the order and would resend. Waited another 7 days, and got nothing. So emailed them and on the 24th they replied. After several emails back and forth they said the person who took my order was no longer there and they would resend. Never got anything. Emailed again on 8/4/15. Same excuses. Emailed agan on 8/12, &#34;sorry...&#34; same excuses. Finally on 8/15/15 they provided a tracking no. However the postal system showed only that the label had been created. The item did not ship until almost a week later. 8/21. We got the new parts on 8/24/15 but they are the wrong parts. They are for a different car and do not look anything like what is on the car or their website. The website shows the exact part we need, but they did not send it. So I called and put on hold for 15 minutes, had to hang up. Emailed again and they just said &#34;sorry we must not have that part, you can send them back for a refund.&#34;<br /><br />So now my son has a none working car. This WAS his favorite toy. He drove it every single day. Now I have to come up with another $200-$400 to buy another car because the company can\\'t ship me a single $25 part! If you are a parent you know that feeling when you child looks at you with that face. &#34;Why can\\'t I drive my car?&#34;<br /><br />I will NOT buy another &#34;Best Ride On Car&#34; because they have the WORST customer service!\"\\nbroke easy\\n\"friend of mine purchased this product, wood was poor quality and cover didn\\'t work as it has no side drop whatsoever, orange tone on wood, 80s oak style - yik\"\\nDid not work right out of the box. Only one of the rotors turns. Will not get off ground.  Very disappointed.\\n\"We couldn\\'t get the acorns to actually launch.  Maybe user error, but on the other hand, using a kids toy shouldn\\'t really be too complicated!\"\\nDid not work at all and threw it away.  Slide not very slippery and did not shoot water out like it should.\\nStruggles to cut 16ga and doesn\\'t cut clean\\n\"Grossly dissatisfied with product packaging. Cute item, but arrived in 3 plastic bags and 2 were open. Poly bag was filled with block parts. Have purchased Sluban products in past and arrived in box. Assumed this would as well. Was hoping to give as Christmas gift, but due to no box and opened bags, unable to do so. Will purchase similar items in future as they are cute items. However, will most likely purchase elsewhere!\"\\n\"I was hoping these would be bigger, but they are maybe 6 inches tall! They don\\'t work for my purposes but maybe for something else!\"\\nIt only contained one mini figure.  We thought according to the picture and description there would be more.  Really let down.\\n\"I am really bummed by this purchase. I usually read reviews and didn\\'t on this one - my mistake. For some reason I assumed the pillow would be round like a marble (perhaps because the pillow is called a &#34;Gumball&#34;??). I should not have assumed. It is round, but more like a peppermint. It\\'s very tiny. About the size of a dinner plate. I should have paid attention to the size listed. The pillow is also poorly made. It has taken on a smushed shape and the fuzz has not recovered. My two year old son would like it, but then again he\\'s two and likes running around with paper towel tubes on his arms. I returned it immediately.\"\\nNeed customer service or i have to return it ..Just beeps loudly and beeps. Cant bind transmitter to the quad.<br /> I ordered extra parts and batteries too.\\n\"I remember how fun this game was when we would sit around the table and ask our own made up questions. Then, I came across the actual game! I had to buy it. We just played it last night and 8 out of 9 people were begging for a new game. The questions were lame and the game was a total bust. I wouldn\\'t recommend it.\"\\nPull the tabs and the batteries go with it.  Half didn\\'t work and the other half either popped very quickly or already had holes.\\n\"Very disappointed, not what they say they are. Very small, not 5 inches\"\\n\"The skirt and top look like they would match, but they don\\'t. At all. The top is neon pink and the skirt is a very deep raspberry color. Also, the top is too small for both her our generation and her AG doll\"\\nI only gave one star bc my grand baby enjoyed her first mail delivery but ur eggs sucked  Never mind the chocolate was melted and gross but the penny toys were awful.\\nI guess I did not expect it to be this small but my grandson likes it that\\'s what counts\\nTears like tissue paper.\\n\"Not worth the shipping, scratched and just plain old junk.\"\\n\"This product appears to be well built, especially for it`s size. However the problems started as soon as I opened the box. The instruction pamphlet is so small that I had to copy & enlarge all nine pages just to read it. Next, as I tried to read the instructions I discovered that the translation from chinese to english is virtually unintelligible.After several hours of trying I was not able to complete the required programming and as a result although I could get it to fly, I was not able to control it. I did discover that although the instructions said that it had a range of 30 meters (94.4 feet), it did not respond to the controls at 6 meters ( 20 feet). Finally, when I contacted the seller, they did not acknowledge or address the translation issue, they just told me to return the unit at my expense and that if they did not find anything wrong that I would be charged a restocking fee.<br /> I do not recommend this product or any other products offered by thi company.\"\\nPoor quality\\n\"these pencils do not live up to their ad--the points break repeatedly. I try to sharpen them but the points keep breaking. I store them points up & carefully, but they still break. Very disappointed.\"\\nBe aware that the train that comes with the book is NOT James.  It is Charlie.  Seems kind of odd.\\nThis is a poor quality product. There isn\\'t much stretch and the &#34;skin&#34; is super thin and tears easily. Within 5 minutes this was in the trash.\\nGift\\n\"Though I ordered 2XL, there is no way these compression shorts are 2XL - way too small and tight.\"\\n\"Cards are soft cardboard, not thick enough\"\\nHorrible description. Returned the item and they refuse to give me my money back.\\nOrdered 3 boxes of 6 inflatables.  Had only 6 hold air.  Amazon Customer Service was great in handling the return.\\nThe coat is way to tight for any size child.  My daughter is really skinny but a 1 1/2 years old the coat was too tight for her to wear.\\nOrdered twice and received used items. I won\\'t try again.\\n\"Love the pop, specially the glow in the dark.  Box came in a manner that appeared a dog chewed on it, ordered a replacement!\"\\nremote works if you are six inches away from the bulb.\\n\"I was going to give this as a gift, but the quality is not suitable. The throwing knives are made of plastic and the ribbon was cheaply glued on that you can see the threads and glue. Also, the throwing knives did not come in the nice box that is pictured. They came in plastic packaging that was already opened. If you\\'re looking for cheap quality toys, then this is great for you. So disappointed.\"\\n\"I have no issues at all with water pressure.  I have other yard sprinklers that work perfectly.  My wife thought this was cute for the kids, but we should have stuck with our regular sprinkler, which is perfectly suited for kids.  The water barely comes out. We got maybe 6&#34; of water height.  I returned it.\"\\nVery inferior goods !\\n\"Worse buy ever , this kit those not come with all the bolts needed for the traxxas summit ,and some bolts the Allen head the not come the tight sizes so the strip really easily ,<br />I have install the trany bolts. And now I want to remove , and 2 bolts are strip ,<br />Junk don\\'t buy , u will be having a hard time with them\"\\nSix dollars for one basket? Thats OBSURD.\\n\"One of the two we ordered came with the seam already torn.  Didn\\'t have time to return before or trip so we duct taped it to make it lay the weekend. I half expected it considering all the reviews, but I would like a refund on at least one of the chairs since it came defective.\"\\nProduct did not work when it arrived. Have not had time to follow up yet but plan to contact seller.\\nIt lasted two days before the antenna broke off. Big disappointment for my 9 yo.\\n\"Although, this product is fun for the kids it does not hold up. We have only had a couple of weeks and the seems have come unglued causing water to get inside of it. water tots should hold up better than that.\"\\nThese took forever to get here and once they arrived they were complete garbage. Half just fall off and the other half pop. Do not recommend.\\n\"I was very disappointed with the quality of this construction paper. It is very thin, almost like printer paper. there were only a few sheets of the white paper, which seemed even thinner than the other colors. The Sunworks construction paper is much better.\"\\nC-\\nDo not order this. No lights. Pile of junk. I am throwing it away before it makes my kids cry. Thanks for taking my money. Enjoy it. I hope you can put it to better use than scamming other people with your crap product.\\nnot real legos knock off!!!!\\nStill havent been able to put this thing together! There were no instructions with the product! Very disappointed!\\nDoes not work well and leaks.\\nChair broke smh right after I got it\\nDo NOT buy!! The pictures are misleading and the products are cheap horrible Chinese material! I wanted to return my product or demand a refund but figured it may not be worth the hassle since it comes from over seas! Horrible!!!!\\nThis car keeps shutting off on me it go\\'s forward 10 feet then stops. W.T.F.???\\nOne motor was not working and a second one quit shortly after first use\\nAn absolute piece of crap with a huge crack in the middle of the &#34;hammering sides&#34;. Dont waste your money with that (assumingly not licensed) product.\\nThis was a bust but I guess that\\'s expected since it was cheapish. It broke right away but the kids still slid around on it. It\\'s also really short.\\nCheap plastic\\nFell apart almost immediately after we got them.\\nReceived the Kung Fu Panda dirty. It didn\\'t do everything that was advertised it would do.\\n\"velcro is not working anymore after a few months, and also the mat is very thin and uncomfortable.\"\\nI received the British version which was not included in the description anywhere.\\nCheaply made and wrong pieces sent to assemble.\\n\"Unfortunately, this butterfly was DOA.....it just didn\\'t work, so I returned it for a refund.\"\\ndid not run as seen on youtube\\n\"It broke in the second day...what else needs to be said.  This crane is very cheaply made--the plastic is brittle and the gears that drive the tracks stripped on us.  When it does drive, it\\'s very jerky.  We were fooled by the &#34;discount&#34; from an inflated full price.  Honestly, it\\'s the quality that I expect from a Dollar Store.\"\\nI should have listened to the other reviews. If you don\\'t have &#34;extreme water pressure&#34; then one side WILL NOT shoot water as pictured! Heck it will barley even make it to the other side of the slide. After about an hour it started to trickle out of the holes. (again I said trickle)<br /><br />I assumed mine water pressure was better than most or at least adequate enough. I remember playing on slip and slides as a kid and water pressure was never an issue. Not sure why these slides don\\'t seem to be as good as the old ones.<br /><br />For the price I would say the product is okay! You get some good room for 2 sliders to have fun (7-10 year olds) and we didn\\'t really use the boogie boards. So just be aware of the water pressure issue and don\\'t purchase is you want/expect it to look like the picture LOL\\n\"I bought two of these a year ago but finally got the chance to unbox and inflate them at the lake yesterday. I inflated both of them, and within 30 minutes they deflated. I noticed both rafts had a HUGE hole in the seam next to the area you inflate it by, like it wasn\\'t glued together correctly during manufacturing. Our family was super disappointed we couldnt enjoy our float trip, and I am upset that I wasted money on these! Looking through comments now, I see that there was a recall and many people have had the same problem. Since it has been a year, I am not sure what to do!\"\\nCheap knock off. Pieces don\\'t click together easily & a few broke right off the bat. I ordered Brain Flakes from Viahart that are more expensive so we\\'ll see if those are the real thing.\\nThrew it away the second I opened it. Didn\\'t work. Complete waste of money\\nBox was in bad condition\\n\"This pen never worked! We followed the instructions VERY carefully, but the pen was terrible right out of the box. Very disappointed! Thanks Amazon for the smooth and quick return, we\\'re going to try a different brand of 3D pen. The original Doodler worked well until it broke. We are not impressed with this company.\"\\nNot worth it...too pricey ..I had to buy my own glue ...glue that comes with it is useless\\nDoes not work right out of the box.\\n\"Do not buy this! The reason Build-A-Bear Workshop has discontinued this toy is because the &#34;satin&#34; on its stomach rips out with no provocation from the user (Mine did.). This item is faulty and should not be bought for any price, especially the exorbitant price this seller wants to charge. Beware of ripoffs like this one.\"\\n\"Gave flying pig as a gift and the first time recipient tried to use, the fabric tore and no longer able to return because I ordered more than 30 days before her birthday.  She barely pulled back and it gave away--looks like a flaw in the fabric.  Very disappointed but stuck with a broken toy.\"\\nSmaller than it seems..\\n\"Super cute, but buckle broke the very first time my daughter tried to put it on her doll.\"\\nNever recover the card. Still waiting\\nThe mesh ripped within 1 week and with VERY LITTLE use.\\nBelieve the reviews.  This was purchased for a little mermaid water party.  Leaks at hose connection from get go so not enough pressure to operate correctly.  It does not stand up.  We had to create stakes to keep it upright.  Wouldn\\'t be worth it if it was free.\\nI received the backpack and lunch box but not the water bottle. It upsets me because i didnt receive what i paid for.\\n\"Didnt buy from amazon nevertheless its 5th edition. I should have realized, the quality of outside box itself was tacky. But the price point is same as before (~40$). The game components are all wrong, few missing I suppose. They wont align properly, the board wont set up, cards not punched properly so tearing apart when you try to remove them. I have seen this game before (earlier edition) so I know the difference. It used to be sturdy with really re-play value over quite few times (earlier version).<br />Some new guy came in and must have decided to cut costs, and deliver a vastly inferior product in end. Mind you, its a popular game and vastly enjoyable so they thought could get away with this. But as I said, Stay away from this, dont even ask for replacement until they take steps to improve production.\"\\nThese are so small I didn\\'t even bother to open!  Pictures misrepresent the product.  Returning today!\\nThese did not fit and broke before the night I purchased these for in the first place. No returns are accepted with any cosmetic dental good.\\nit wast my money only\\nNothing has sprouted and it\\'s been months. My son was dissapointed\\nThis box is flimsy and cheaply made in China. I don\\'t know how the other reviews found this item to be rated the way it has. Mine came with finger prints embedded within the top lid coating. Not worth the 50.00 bucks plus that I paid.\\nThis product is NOT adjustable as it appears in the pictures. It\\'s just a teddy bear and arms are too far apart to hold our tablet as it keeps falling out. The arms do not adjust at all and you also can\\'t recline the bear as it appears in pictures. It\\'d have been exactly same if I\\'d used any other stuffed toy to just place tablet on it. This did a poor job of it & can only hold it for few seconds before it slips out. I\\'m disappointed since it\\'s such a hassle to return items to Amazon to get a refund.\\nThese were such a disappointment. We ordered them for our sons birthday party. We threw away 3 bc we couldn\\'t get them to hold air even with duct tape and the rest we had to keep re inflating and using duct tape over the inflation point. We got them 2 days before the party or I would have returned them\\n\"Ecen though the baseball cap was OK I was quite dissapointed by the quality of the backpack & lunchpack. They are thin, and not at all sturdy and the worst part was the chemical smell of both the backpack & lunchpack. Only with time did it pass somewhat, no amount of washing helped.\"\\n\"This item came with a broken arm, completely snapped off.\"\\nI was told it was a kid size and is an adults size I would love to send it back.\\nOne of the markers was doubled.  I kept getting the oh you need to talk to this person run around so I stopped running... They smell great but I got two mint markers and zero chocolate markers... Not the best marker to omit...\\ntwo of the four tubes had holes. Definitely should have bought them at Kmart\\n\"Literally broke apart within the first 20 minutes of playtime. My 3 year old is super bummed and disappointed after waiting over the weekend to receive this. If $6 doesn\\'t buy a decent quality water gun that lasts more than a few minutes, what does it buy?\"\\nThis was a Christmas gift and it broke right out of the box!\\n\"As many others noted, this guitar is kind of a hunk of junk.  However, it was the one requested by my son and daughter-in-law for their 3 year old son for his birthday, so I went ahead and got it.  There is no way to tune the strings on this.  It has pegs, but they don\\'t stay put when you tighten a string, and the first string broke after about 3 turns - it wan\\'t even tight yet.  The bridge fell right off - no sign that it had ever been attached in any way.  On the plus side - it\\'s the perfect size for a 3 year old, and he didn\\'t really care that it couldn\\'t be tuned or that the bridge wasn\\'t there.  He just loved having a guitar and being able to strum the strings, even though they are all loose.\"\\nThey broke when I got them out of the packages\\n\"Bought this and within 4 hours the screen buttons no stopped working.  The only thing i can think is it couldn\\'t handle a little baby drool, which for a toy rated for 6 months and up I would have thought it would be a lot more robust.\"\\nProduct did not work after placing to separate sets of Batteries???\\nIt doesnt even fly anymore it sucks\\n\"The seat does not allow the baby to sit in a comfortable position, there is no structure to it, my son used it once and cried the whole time, I think because there is no give in the seat he was very uncomfortable.\"\\nwaste of money. Not worth the effort to have most toys repaired\\n\"Bag looks great, but the straps ripped off after 4 hours on the beach.  Also, the cinchy-plastic thing doesn\\'t hold so I had to tie it shut.  You\\'re better off using a 99 cent reusable grocery bag.  Way cheaper and more sturdy.\"\\nFigure is so tiny.\\n\"It\\'s a nice idea to try to package this as a potable device - Once my sun tok it to the park for a ride and hit a bump, the back wheel snapped off? I would not recommend this item to anyone looking for a trike that will last over a month/\"\\nComplete junk - very &#34;stinky&#34; and very cheap. I returned this item and bought real dice cups. There was zero effort at quality here whatsoever and the smell from the plastic or whatever chemicals used to make these is just nauseating.\\nThe battery is the right size but it has flat connectors instead of the rounds ones.\\ndoesn\\'t hold anything\\nSave your money. This is made of extremely low quality products. We inflated it and it never stood up straight to use as a goal. After a couple weeks the netting was completely falling a part. Would not recommend.\\nArrived broken\\nThese cups don\\'t hold up very well at all. They kind of disintegrate after a little while.\\nBeams was damaged upon receipt\\nLost pressure after one day\\nAbsolutely horrible.  I got about 5 out of the 100 to stay filled.

Honestly, I can hardly get them apart and my fingers are sore after finally managing to separate all of the layers.  Great toy if you want to sit with your child and play in frustration.\"\\nThe picture on the card I received was weird. It had a Lin in it that caused the full image to not line up.

Do NOT buy this piece of junk.\"\\n\"This was SO much fun!  For TWO days...  Like so many other reviews, it started leaking between the seams.  I didn\\'t want to buy it for exactly this reason, but it was my son\\'s main wish for his birthday...  I was thrilled that I was able to ship it back for a full refund with no questions asked.  Seems to me the manufacturer would spend a little time and some resources to fix the problem.  We actually had decided (the first day) to buy a second one, but the deflation axed that idea.\"\\nThis is the first time I\\'ve ever given up on a puzzle.

It only glows for 2 minutes! &#62;:(  I will never buy this product.  It\\'s a waste of money.\\nbad wand and very poor solution quality!!!\\nNot the best quality\\n\"It is VERY small.  Don\\'t let the picture fool you.  You need a very tiny baby to even think about using it.  It says up to 18 months, but I tried with my 6 month old and it would not keep her upright.  There are much more stable rafts out there, and even though it\\'s only $10, don\\'t waste your money.  I will put my child in this again.\"\\n\"flips all the time, must use in smooth surface...\"\\nThis is a rip off!\\n\"This was the second one I have ordered, they break easy.\"\\n\"[[VIDEOID:277a908018e6da843f3c8b8fcf4cbdd5]]UPDATE - I came back to change my review on this item.  After maybe a few days of playing with this, the gun has broken.  The part that you cock back to be able to pull the trigger broke right off.  I was there when it happened and the kids weren\\'t being exceptionally rough but just pulled it down and it snapped off.  So I have changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star since the toy is now no longer usable.<br /><br />Original 5 star review below:<br /><br />I have three boys ages 8-14 who have a ton of water guns.  We have all different size guns, different style of guns, manual guns and battery operated guns.  My kids really love playing with water guns and it\\'s such a cheap, fun activity I enocurage it.  It also get them out running around and exercising.<br /><br />The Super Jet Action Gun is a nice size gun.  My youngest is able to easily hold it and use it.  It works like a shot gun where you have to cock the gun each time.  I thought this would really slow my kids down but it doesn\\'t seem to at all.  The lever you pull down is really not very hard to pull down.  The trigger is then easy to pull.  My sons have been pretty rough on this gun and it has continued to work great.  It shoots a nice stream of water pretty far across the yard.  My 14 year old has pretty good aim and could hit his brothers from a pretty good distance.<br /><br />The tank or reservoir in this gun is not huge but for the size of the gun, it\\'s about like our others.  So far I don\\'t have any complaints about this gun.  The gun is very lightweight.  It has worked well each time my boys have played with it.  They like how far it shoots.  Like I said, they have played pretty rough iwth the gun and it shows no signs of wear at this point.<br /><br />Product provided as a free promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.\"\\n\"It is a terribly designed product and just not worth the money. I am just being too lazy to even pack it again and send it back! The bubbles don\\'t form, the wheels don\\'t roll well and my toddler was bored of it in 5 minutes\"\\nBank did not have arm card and broken.\\n\"Ordered two of these for my kids as i cant find them local.  After numerous days waiting, both finnaly arrived.  As soon as i opened the pack, 1 was already dead and never lite up.  the other one lite up and we used it for maybe 2 minutes, and then the battery in it died!  there is no way to change the batteries in these and when i emailed the merchant for a new item to try, or even a $5 refund, i got numerous emails back and forth giving me the run around and telling me how to cut them on and off. They were very unprofessinal and made me feel uncomfortable!  i would not buy again!\"\\nThe outfit is cute but it is falling apart after only 1 wear.  Will have to attempt to sew together the skirt layers which is unfortunate.\\n\"This shopping cart is very lightweight and flimsy. The seat can be easily discombobulated, the basket lifts up, if any pressure is put on the handle it flips over, the front wheels NEVER go the correct direction so it isn\\'t even easy to push around. I was going to return the item, but the company wanted to charge return shipping AND a restocking fee. After contesting they agreed to forgive one of the two, but it still wasn\\'t worth the return. Save your money on this and buy the more expensive one from the brand you know and trust!! I wish I would have spent $50 instead of $30 to not be stuck with this toy that isn\\'t worth even $10!\"\\nIt came with hair on it.\\nDon\\'t waste your money.\\ndoesn\\'t look like picture - real cheaply made\\nPOS... put in brand new batteries.  Car worked great for 5 minutes then totally stopped.  Couldn\\'t get it going again no matter what I tried.\\nI was tricked into believing the items size was bigger.\\n\"This yoyo has a plastic transaxle, not a ball bearing.  I ordered two and only one would light up at all and then only on one half.  What a piece of garbage.  For a solid light up looping yoyo look to the Duncan Pulse.  Yomega has fallen a long way since the yoyo craze of the late 90s.\"\\nPlastic is weightless and cracks easily. I am returning the product. Do not order this product.\\n\"This product didn\\'t work and only had a 30-day return policy.  Since I ordered it for a gift, I was unaware it didn\\'t work until day 32.\"\\nI guess I didn\\'t read the description. It\\'s tiny. Not at all what I expected.\\nPretty cheesy\\nlooking at the item on its page I thought I was buying a box full of tiny cheaply made bobble heads. I missed where it said &#34;includes one mini figure&#34;. that makestake was mine but if it says &#34;includes&#34; I was definitely looking for something more. of course it would &#34;includes&#34; a bobble head! had it said &#34;contains&#34; so I wasn\\'t looking for more than one cheaply made bobble head I wouldn\\'t be so disappointed. I paid basically $10 INCLUDES shipping for one cheaply made bobble head. I am not happy with this purchase and its not worth the aggravation to return it either. the way this item was portrayed on the paged is definatley misleading and I would not recommend this to anyone.\\nVery SMALL!!\\nTattoos were hard to use and did not evenly apply to your arm.  Bought them for our daughter\\'s birthday party and was very disappointed that they did not stay on well.\\nOne of the guns broke the first day.\\nThey come with no heads. You have to glue them on yourself. I don\\'t understand why. They call it the Figure Head optional head system. All the heads pretty much look the same and the figures are so small you can\\'t tell the difference between them. It\\'s just dumb\\nDo not buy this toy unless you want receipts coming out saying beer for 5.00$!<br />I want to throw it in the trash!  Plus the cash register key broke first turn around!  Cheap and awful for a child!  I really don\\'t want my 3 year old having play receipts with beer wrote on them!\\n\"Absolutely terrible. Cheaply made. Does not hold together. Instructions are awful. If you are looking for the most frustrating experience of your life, you found it.\"\\nHOOOORRRIIBBBLLLEEEEEE<br />SO CHINZY<br />Big waste. We are returning them. If you put 4 helium balloons on this thing it would fly away immediately! Totally over priced.\\nI hate this bag of shark teeth\\nCrap! My quad vibrated so much afterwards I took it off and used 1/2&#34; pic pipe for legs. Save your money.\\nvery high price.\\n\"I received the regular battleship game, not electronic\"\\nI didn\\'t realize the characters on the stamp is no what the stamp actually is. was disappointed.\\n\"Fraud!!!!!<br />This item is not the not the Edushape Ltd.brand as advertised!<br />The real manufacturer is TOTO TOYS LTD from Kowloon, Hong Kong.\"\\n\"It does not fly properly. It can fly only up and down. No sideways movement. The tail rotor is not rotating at all. I brought this back home to india, and cant even return the product... Stuck with a broken item.\"\\nThis is the worst thing that I ever bought on Amazon!! I will be reporting this!! They sent four little helmets when they should have sent two helmets and two small football figures like in the picture!! The birthday cake will look stupid and cheap now!! This is literally the worst product that I have EVER been duped into buying!! I\\'m calling AMAZON right now!!! I am so mad!!\\nI bought a bunch of these balls. I know they are rubber balls but the smell was just too strong.  I also feel that they are just too hard for use with young children.  These are mini replicas of those red school yard kickballs and will cause damage if used indoors.\\n\"One star is because the stickers are cute and work on kids own nails.  But the press on nails don\\'t stay on AT ALL--I mean, if your child just sits there and doesn\\'t move at all, they\\'d probably stay on longer.  We got all of the nails onto her fingers and she was super excited and said, &#34;I\\'m going to show daddy.&#34; She went to the other room and returned, saying that 3 of the nails were already lost.  The rest fell off over the next 5 minutes.  I\\'m pretty sure it took longer to get them on, than the amount of time they actually stayed on.  Would be great if the product worked at all.\"\\n\"I\\'ve never written a review for any product I\\'ve ordered on Amazon, but this was a complete waste of money! The costume\\'s shorts fit like pants on my 2 year old (it\\'s not that it\\'s too big on her, the cut of the shorts are just plain awful) the shirt is made of the cheapest, stiffest fabric and it did not come with shoe toppers as advertised on the description. You\\'re much better off purchasing a pair of orange shorts and a plain pink tshirt!\"\\nbacks open way too easily\\nWorked OK for a few days. My son really enjoyed &#34;fishing&#34; from our pool. Screwed in the battery cover properly but unfortunately when I went to change the batteries they were water damaged.My guess is water was getting into the battery compartment after a few days because it started sinking to the bottom of the pool making it impossible to use instead of swimming at the surface like it did when we initially started using it.\\nThis is different than the one I had received the first time. Inconsistency in product. Not happy with the way this koala looks. Prefer the one I purchased before which was much smaller and cuter. I was looking for the exact one I had previously purchased for a gift and this is remarkably different.\\nI bought this for my one year old granddaughter but the top clear portion was easily removed by her exposing the small pieces that she could choke on. Very disappointed!\\nPack weight already...\\nwrong products.\\n\"it doesn\\'t make the noise it is suppose to make, it is not loud and it doesn\\'t make the noise a slide whistle should make\"\\nstiff not balanced don\\'t work well at all.\\nPurchased this slip and slide for 16 dollars and it lasted about 2 hours before it ripped and turned my beautiful lawn into a gigantic mud pie - do yourself a favor - save your money and just by a fun sprinkler for the kids to run through or a stationary pool\\n\"Had to try to fix one of shooting devices.  By the time I had, the other was broke.  Very cheaply made.\"\\nTerrible !!! What a rip off!!!  Small ... ;(\\nWas not what I was expecting. If I hadn\\'t needed a gift to give someone the day it arrived it would have been sent back. Disappointed. Already falling apart after a day. Not worth the money at all :(\\nWe have only used its own pen with water but the pages are already scratched after the first use.\\n\"The quality of this gun is truly horrendous, it was cheap but really, its not even worth the $5 and change you have to pay. The gun came open already, when trying to close it the cloth just remains exposed and the &#34;metal&#34; that is used for the gun is just sad. I\\'ve never disappointed with a product that I\\'ve purchased online as much as this one. Might have to end up buying another gun at a Halloween store, I seriously doubt it\\'ll make it till October and its also horrible for my cosplay (which is the reason for my purchase.)\"\\n\"Very poorly made.  Strings would not tune.  Very cheap materials.  Had to send it back which made my grandson extremely unhappy, but not worth the money.\"\\nIt was a big waste of money it broke right out of the box...  I do not recommend this!\\nIt was very cheap and it tore in the matter of hours\\n\"This travel size is unusable - the cards are so small that it would be impossible to hold them and the board is unreadable.  I made a mistake in thinking that this was the full size product and, because it was an international shipper, now I\\'m stuck with this unusable product.  Lesson learned.\"\\nThis was the worst puzzle I ever put together. the plastic was very cheap and the pieces were very hard to lock in. in came in just plastic no box. when I finished the puzzle it had gaps because the pieces were hard to put in place. I was very disappointed with this product.\\n\"im not sure if mine was just old, shelved for too long . when we opened it it seemed fine, my 5 year old daughter liked it and than ,overnight the battery leaked out on to the dresser, the acid burned thru wood stain :( i threw it away right away\"\\n\"I just got my drone and after 1 day it broke, so i ordered a replacement and i just got it today AND IT BROKE AFTER A TOTAL OF 5 MINUTES!!!!!!!! it was flying good before but then poof! 1 propeller just stopped working! SO DO NOT BUY THIS! it flies good yet propellers stop working after 5 MINUTES!!\"\\nWe were not happy.  My small 4 year old grandson could not get it to go.  No power at all.  Very disappointed !!!\\nIt was a tiny tiny figurine. Not worth the price. I will not be ordering them again.\\nvery cheap. not like the original trouble\\ndidn\\'t like that thet squeak\\n\"Didn\\'t fit on the bike. It\\'s built to anticipate a very large handle bar cross bar. Newer bikes (like the most common Huffy in the entire world) have smaller cross bars on them. After working in the garage and making it fit, the side-to-side action only worked for a day. Then it just stopped.<br /><br />When it did work, it was pretty cool, but there is no way I would recommend buying this. It\\'s an overpriced disappointment.\"\\n\"Stopped working within a week.  Replaced batteries, but still didnt work.  Problem also is that there isnt much to do but sit and watch cars go round in circles while you hope for a crash.  Kinda like NASCAR in that respect.\"\\nVery small. Not for younger kids. Pretty cheap.\\nTerrible!  Did not freeze the mixture and made a mess.\\nSo damaged not worth anything so unhappy it\\'s not even right how people do hot wheels collectors\\nWaste of money!\\nFalse ad no camera on the box!! Just got 1 open the box no camera\\n\"Not a Nanoblock. That\\'s enough said really, it\\'s a cheap knockoff. Not really a knockoff because the packaging was not branded Nanoblock.\"\\n\"Awful! It does not stand up, it impossible to fill the air in the bottom to make it stand so it sat sideways on the lawn spraying the water horizontally! Do not waste your money!\"\\nCars flew off the track and killed my cat!!!!!\\ndid not receive anything but the notebooks.....had to send back\\nRubber bands dont do a good job.  They begin to leak and after 15 mins all balloons were deflated.  Good idea bad implementation.\\nFell apart in 2 weeks with typical kid play.  The motor stuck &#34;on&#34; within 1 week.  Terrible product.  Are negative stars possible?\\nThe green lining tore after 2 weeks. Terrible bag. :(\\nBad thing. The moment I received it for my son to use I unwrapped it and tried it then gave it to my 2 years old son just 5 minutes then I look around the pen tip was lost vanished from the room and the board became useless!\\nDo not recomend. Bubble pops fast cant hardly jugle. Not worth money.\\n\"Don\\'t waste your money, this is TOTAL junk...<br />We purchased this twice since my son really wanted it for costume dress up.... The first one broke literaly within 30 seconds of being out of the box, he had not even tried it on, it broke as we were unpacking it.....<br />We thought maybe we got a faulty but the second one was equally junky....\"\\nbroke in one day\\nThese balloons are NOT mint green and not even close to the photo!! They are a dark teal color.  Please change the description on these balloons - it is misleading.  I was very disappointed.\\narrived one day late.  would not light up.  changed battery and still does not work.  dud.\\nThe toy fell onto its side. My son stepped on the red part of the base and the stick in the center of the base slammed into his forehead. It happened twice in a row. He cried a lot. The company should take into consideration that children will step on the toy and should try to prevent any injuries resulting from this with a better design.\\n\"Very cheaply made, doesn\\'t stay together well.\"\\nThe headband was so tight that it left red marks behind both of my 6 year olds ears.\\nI bought one of these and am almost positive that it\\'s not authentic.  The antenna arrived unattached and the product in a generic brown box.  The mask itself is of very low quality.\\nWaste of money. Buy more expensive\\nTotal disappointment. Plug for keeping air in was flimsy and useless....so the bag wouldn\\'t hold enough air to work. DON\\'T BUY THIS.\\nThis has stopped working after 35 days of having it. I have changed the batteries several times and it will only blow 1 -2 bubbles at a time. Wish it was working the way it did when we first got it... :-(  And of course its past the 30 of having it.\\nI love the marvel select line of toys. This rating isn\\'t a reflection on the product but on the company that handled the figure. I received a damaged figure with the box torn open.\\nThis is VERY small and the wheels broke off the next day\\n\"This was so much fun for the first two weeks, then it stopped working completely.  No bubbles, no music.  Nothing.  We tried new batteries, but it just don\\'t work.  It almost seems like it\\'s not really a bath toy and not supposed to get wet.  In any case, Amazon is letting us return it.  Would not recommend buying.\"\\nThe trigger mechanism stopped working after about 10 shots. I expected better quality. Do not recommend !!\\nThis is a balloon. NOT a piñata. Wasting my time returning now!\\nVery thin and cheaply made. I would have gotten a better set at walmart for $20.\\n\"The ties on the balloons are too loose, and the water leaks out quickly.  Only about 50% of the balloons we inflated were usable.  I\\'ve had much better success with a different brand of self-tying water balloons.\"\\nIt\\'s cheep<br />You have to put in work to make it hold the net up right\\nDarn book didn\\'t work upon arrival & it was part of a baby shower gift! Very disappointed!\\n\"Jams way to easily and eats up darts, if you get make sure you order plenty of extra darts\"\\nWe gave these as a gift - and they did not work!  The kids were so disappointed :-(\\n\"Not all of the balloons filled, and the ones that did were super tiny. These things were more of a weapon than a water balloon. They were too small that they didn\\'t break. Look elsewhere.\"\\nnot much pressure and broke after 3 times of use\\nToo small. Smaller than it seems\\n\"Like others have posted, this was a huge disappointment.  A million tiny barely magnetic pieces.  The game board sheets are paper and tear super easily.  The zipper on the carrying case broke on the first use.  We basically just used the boards as white wipe boards.  We were excited to have new travel games and this lasted about 12 minutes.\"\\n\"Falls off and hard to get to block sun very well, I usually take it off and wouldn\\'t buy again.\"\\n\"So I ignored All of the other reviews & thought  it can\\'t be that Bad... well it was<br />\\'\\' it was my sons Birthday present\\'<br />THE TENT IT SELF IS PRETTY CHEAP<br />THE FABRIC IS SEE THRU & PLASTIC POLES ARE VERY FRAGIL,THEY BENT EASY.<br />And THE NIGHT LIGHT DID NOT EVEN WORK \\' VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!

For some reason has an extremely short power cord (about 6&#34; long) and the connector does not feel particularly safe. A great idea that our kids loved that I wish they had made higher quality.\\nI had to return this star pillow. The battery pack had no on and off switch. There was no way to turn it on.\\ni ordered these masks twice and both times they came broken in half!! certainly do not recommend.\\nToo small our kids – meant for toddlers\\nAdvertised with 20 keys but the one I received had 2!\\n\"Did not work for a single use.  Never extruded, still trying to troubleshoot but customer support is aweful....\"\\nno stars.....I mean seriously?  I thought this was going to be at least 8.5 inches tall?  where did they measure from.....the palm of my tiny hand is larger than this?!!  going to try and return it....was trying to get something my grandson could take to bed with him...not something to hang from a keychain?  So disapointed!!!\\nIt stopped working only after days of play. Certainly made from China.

The seller kindly refunded. The second one had the same problems. The motors burn out after only a few uses. I wouldn\\'t recommend this product. There are plenty of cost effective drones out there.\"\\nCHEAP PIECE OF S***.\\n\"As another reviewer wrote, the fires look different from the main photo. They are actually like the last picture, small red cups. My son put one in his mouth because he likes drink bath water (ew, I know) and it was easily sucked into his mouth. My husband was able to get it out with some effort, but it could have been much worse, and the way the cups are shaped would have created an airtight seal over his throat, completely blocking his breathing. It was a close call, and needless to say the cups went in the garbage. Also, as another reviewer said, it\\'s very difficult to actually fill dusty with water. My son just floats him around and uses the button to make the propeller spin. It\\'s a shame, because he was very excited about this toy. Parent\\'s beware! My son is 3, by the way.\"\\nOur kids spent a few minute with this and then were done forever.  Spinning in it doesn\\'t work very well and sitting in it is uncomfortable.  I\\'m not sure why other people are so pleased with these because our ended up at the dump within a year.\\n\"Terrible/cheap product design.  Game base does not sit flat on a table (marble compartment underneath sticks out, and makes the entire unit wobble).  Should also come with anti-skid rubber pieces, which I will be adding myself.  The hippo heads/necks lock up very frequently and gameplay is very frustrating, especially to small children.  The only way to get the game back into the box is by removing the hippo pieces, which will inevitably breaks the plastic tabs used to hold the hippos to the game board.\"\\nBroke on first day of use\\nBought these as replacements after our dog chewed ours up.  These are much larger then the original; and they are not all that great.  They leak terribly.  The tip is so large that water gushed out so it is very hard to draw with them.\\nBox was missing the four players and Master Builder markers...I was looking forward to playing with a few friends at a later date and coincidently missed the return date.\\nThe snake worked for a few weeks before it broke.  The pieces are held together with a plastic cord and this snapped while my daughter was playing with it. This toy is not very sturdy so I would not recommend it.\\nOne week of school with a small laptop only in it. Sides ripped where the shoulder strap attaches. Looks rugged but a pos.

Against my better judgment, I bought this boat for my grandson to race boats with his friends. Took the boat out of box, placed brand new batteries in remote, fully charged boat battery for FIVE hours and followed instructions to the letter. Boat WOULD NOT come on. Please pay attention to the negative reviews. There are so many for a reason. I bought the boat bc there were several that had &#34;fixes&#34; or &#34;modifications&#34; in them. It\\'s just best to skip past this boat and move on to another with better review. We are told STRX is a good boat. Not as fast as this one claims, but at this point anything is faster than 0 mph.\"\\nThe case was ok but the clubs broke in 2 days. Don\\'t waste your miney.\\n\"I don\\'t know what I received, but it wasn\\'t a Lingpo, it doesn\\'t have a logo and it didn\\'t come with a box. I got ripped off.\"\\n\"The first one was defective... determined after a call to V-Tech... They sent a return label, and we got a replacement.... Haven\\'t mounted it because this thing won\\'t fit much of anything...... Unless your crib has super skinny top rails, forget it.  Not impressed with the build quality, or functioning of it...... Really was a waste of money.  The only reason I didn\\'t return it in the first place was that we didn\\'t really get a chance to figure out how useless it was until after the return period passed.  My advice:  buy something else!\"\\nWe\\'re not bright in color and some broke when snapping to get color\\n\"I did not receive the item displayed in the listings photo. That shows a quality solder sucker made almost entirely of machined aluminum. I already own one, and I wanted another. That is not what I got. The item I received was made from cheap plastic in all the places desoldering pumps tend to break, in my experience. I have little doubt that it would not last long before it flies apart in my hand. Also, there was some light shipping damage from being inadequately packaged (see the slight dent in the side of the cylinder in the photo).\"\\n\"These were cheap and flimsy. They are also small and not meant for an average size person. When I tried to return them I said that the arm cords were too short thus making the product defective. They rejected my return request and said that it wasn\\'t sufficient. I then applied to just return them and not only was I supposed to pay for my own return shipping, they also charged me a 20% restocking fee. Forget it. They are not worth $20 to start with and then all that money on top of it. So I gave them to a little girl instead. Will never buy from this company again.\"\\n\"Horribly disappointed. I bought this for my daughter who wore it one day and it completely fell apart, pieces went everywhere so all she has is the tiny bottle. She\\'s completely heartbroken and I\\'m completely livid. Would not purchase this again and do not recommend buying it. Cheaply made even for the price.\"\\nTools are cheap junk and broke immediately .\\n\"The picture one picture misrepresents what is actually packaged. I was looking for a model my 6 year old son and I could put together for his birthday, and I stumbled across this and thought this would be perfect. For approximately $15.00 what is contained in the blister packaging is literally 6 parts, and when assembled (if your parts snap together) is less than a coke can in terms of over all size, and in my opinion has a total value of maybe $7.00. Lets be honest, what you are really paying for is the licensing on this product and nothing more. Yes it was my mistake for not reading the product description, but the normal price for full sized models (1:24 car model for example) is around $15.00 so I just assumed since there were no other product packaging images that this would be one of comparable size.\"\\nReceived the package sealed so was not previously opened. When I opened the product and removed it from package it was already dirty and had obviously been sealed up that way. Also pizza was made poorly and had small holes on the sides. Don\\'t recommend this product.\\nWay too small and the pieces just fall off.\\nCrap\\n\"ummm...Well, the \\'APPLE\\' password works fine, but there is no way to change the password.  It says to &#34;push the right button and turn the letters to change the password\\', but there is no \\'right button.  Actually it says \\'botton\\'...did they mean \\'bottom\\'?  If so, I tried that too, and nothing.  I am either stuck with \\'APPLE\\' or I will have to send it back.\"\\nCheap crap my wife  bought for our kid not a bad thought just a cheap product kids are destructive  they break easy then they may choke\\n\"What an overpriced disappointment. One star is overrated.<br /><br />As someone who has seen almost every episode of Doctor Who from Hartnell forward, when I received the &#34;cookie jar&#34;, which I didn\\'t expect to be a ceramic jem, I was gobsmacked to receive a light weight piece of plastic without even an on/off switch for the pseudo TARDIS in transition sound. This thing could not be more disappointing. Obviously the genius behind this earth bound space ship ( of which the Time Lords were on vacation and oblivious to ) had no intention to pay for the rights for the Doctor Who theme song or anything else that might result in paying residuals that could possibly make this somewhat authentic and entertaining, thus worth paying anything more than $12.00 US, never mind $23.00 as a lightning deal. It\\'s a two piece plastic container which, in no earthly gravity enough I\\'m familiar with, has enough weight to function as a cookie jar. It looked good via the sales pitch, but was incredibly disappointing. I wouldn\\'t give my daughter Teigan the key to this TARDIS. The only cookies she\\'d get were the annoying ones planted on my hard drive.\"\\nNot last long for kid toy. Light stop work in 3 in fish easy broke.\\n\"Lantern puts out decent light, but it does not glow. I have tried moving the switch every way possible and it only lights the white LED\\'s. Thanks for disappointing my kids. The strap also broke within a week of owning it. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.\"\\nI wanted to the first expansion instead I get the second. Which is pretty pointless if you don\\'t have the first one. If you guys can send me the first one for free that would be great.\\nDefinitely not as big as I thought it was going to be. The whole set what\\'s together fits in my palm. Everything is plastic except the dragon balls only worth 40 at the highest in my opinion. Not a happy buy &#62;=|\\n\"I\\'m not too mad because I found this onsale at my local BB&B, but if I had paid this price I would be furious. The light is dim, the projection is terrible and the way it works is silly. To have a ceiling full of stars overhead you\\'d have to sit this thing on your stomach...\"\\n\"The picture was deceiving! I bought this thinking it would be a good starter ramp for my son. He is 14. Even my little girl was to big for it. And the plastic was cheap, with even a small amount of weight on it. It would sink and pop out from under them. I would advise spending the money and buying the heavier duty ramps.\"\\nits absolutly fake\\nIt was damaged pretty badly\\nI didn\\'t receive it within the set days and when received it was cracked I going to tape it and call it a day to many problems\\nThis costume didn\\'t come with the mask\\nIt was a cheap version of what I was hoping to get.\\n\"Not what I expected, it\\'s all plastic. Didn\\'t even get to build it like the older versions that I used to play with when I was a child. My little brother was definitely disappointed with this.\"\\nI bought a bunch of these balls. I know they are rubber balls but the smell was just too strong.  I also feel that they are just too hard for use with young children.  These are mini replicas of those red school yard kickballs and will cause damage if used indoors.\\nTerrible item description. This is an adult size\\nOurs broke the first day. Swam for about 5 minutes and then it never worked again. Son spent his birthday gift card on it and he\\'s so disappointed now.\\n\"Fell apart the first day, fabric ripped and cardboard bottom collapsed. Cheap crap.\"\\na waste\\nnot like it was described\\nCould not get these things to glow....totally useless\\nbattery does not keep a charge. Very upset - Bought it for a spare for a remote control boat for my grandson. Charged it twice and twice it will not hold a charge.\\n\"This thing breaks rather quickly. The fans didn\\'t always turn and if they did, the lights often didn\\'t work. Within a few days it outright stopped working.\"\\nVery unsatisfied piece of junk for sure . Battery won\\'t charge and gear is stripped on right motor\\n\"This was a gift. Opened the box to find one piece missing and one piece broken. Find this toy rather odd to begin with as all these bugs do is bump up against each other and they call it battling? My vote is for less violent toys to begin with so this was a no-brainer, went back the same day.\"\\n\"We bought one to make up an Easter basket for our daughter with a bunch of pool toys. She used it once then set it aside on the pool hardscape. The gooey, sticky texture picked up every imaginable piece of dirt, dust, leaf particle, dog fur, and bug. GROSS! We tossed it in the trash.\"\\n\"Missing pieces, the top needle and some plastic pieces.  It kind of ruined something fun I was going to do with my daughter.  No way to contact seller for missing parts.\"\\nWay smaller than expected\\nDisappointed. This game sucks. It is too manual. Not very functuonal.\\nI bought this item for my son\\'s birthday and it leaks constantly.  It leaks so bad that he can\\'t use it while wearing anything but a bathing suit which defeats the purpose I bought it for (to go with his fireman gear).  Complete junk and the return window lapsed because I bought it a month before his birthday......  Highly disappointed.\\nFollowed care instructions but stopped working after a few uses.\\nHead broke 3 minutes into playing with it.  When going to airplane mode it doesn\\'t pop all the way back in.  Bad enough that even my 3-yr old noticed it immediately...will be returning.\\n\"Stiff, cheap material on outside. Glitter everywhere.\"\\nI didn\\'t love that you have to assemble yourself and these are printed with the serial number right on the front of the pinwheel! Lame.\\nToo small!\\nMy son who is pretty tall at 2 years old could not be able to reach the cycling steps on the front wheel.<br />The sit on the tri-cylce also causes him to slide off the chair.\\n\"I purchased the infant swim float with canopy for my baby and after only 5 uses, the canopy totally collapsed. I\\'m very disappointed since this was $27.99 (on Amazon). I figured with would last a year or two.\"\\nExc3lllen y6\\nDo  not buy these. The hammer is plastic and the helmet sits like a pie tin on your child\\'s head. It will not stay on. We purchased a bunch of these for a summer camp and the kids gave up on the helmets within minutes. The hammers were useless. We are returning the entire order.\\n\"Total waste of money. We followed the directions to the letter, and after two years all we ever got was a bunch of moss and one plant that sort of started to grow, then died. RIP. OFF.\"\\n\"Very poor quality rocks.  Not even worth getting.  When it comes to the toys on the play structure I suppose one feels that poorly made product for a cheap price is fine, but these are slippery and not even worth having for a kids climbing wall.  Also when I went to return them they made me pay for the return shipping which was almost the cost of the product even though it was within the 30 days.\"\\n\"This toy is about 3 inches tall, I was so disappointed. I didn\\'t read the dimensions, so that was my error. However for the price, was not happy and returned the item.\"\\nI\\'ve lost all confidence in REDCAT racing.  I first placed an order for these via their website and THIRTY days later canceled the order because they failed to ship them.  I ordered from here and five days later the part arrived but was useless.<br /><br />One of the dog bones was missing the cross pin at one end.  Free replacement?  I don\\'t care for your replacement policy since your QC of a common part is a total failure.\\n\"Big disappointment. This might be okay for  two people that are just trying to get to know each other,  but I would say that if you have been with someone for a year or more,  chances are,  you\\'ve already gone over all these questions through normal conversations. And some cards are just plain ignorant...&#34;say  something about child abuse &#34;.  That is not a thought-provoking card  or conversation starter....And there are way too many blank cards so that people can think of their own questions...If I knew how to write my own card game I wouldn\\'t have purchased one.<br /> This  Game is incredibly boring and went into the trash the first Night we opened it.\"\\n\"The straps broke during the first use. It seems like an okay quality product that will provide at least one layer of protection, but not if you can\\'t put it on and keep it on. Too bad.\"\\nThese connectors plastic insulator are not designed very well. The brass plugs are very good but the plastic insulator is very difficult to press the plug into.  It takes so much pressure that it almost ruins the entire connector.  I used my vice to press  the plug into the insulator.\\n\"I order this because my little one love trains and cars. Just got the order today in the mail. I was so disappointed by this. It\\'s so poorly made, some of the letters were glued incorrectly. Never buy again. Not worth the time and money\"\\n\"I bought these because my toddler likes to stack and build block towers. Unfortunately, the blocks were too small for him to stack as many as he likes. He became frustrated quickly & a new game ensued. Let\\'s toss them like rocks!! lol.  Maybe I missed it in the description, but I expected regular sized wooden blocks & these are about 1 inch squares at about half the size of regular blocks. The design is cute, but not functional. No parent wants a bunch of tiny little wooden blocks with sharp edges all over the house to accidently step on. (yes, that happened...ouch!) and no kid will keep all of the tiny blocks inside the cart. The string is too small for even toddler to pull around, and if it is for babies, they won\\'t understand that concept, so why? The short string only leaves them to sling it around on the floor..and yes, you guessed it...blocks flying all over the place! Cute idea, but not practical.  We played with it for 2 days, tops! I don\\'t recommend.\"\\nThey are broke already the phone part to the ear came off the first day.\\na piece of junk avoid !!!\\n\"The boat goes really fast and it was a lot of fun. After the first time my son used it I considered buying a second boat. However, the battery only lasted 2 recharges before it died. This boat was a birthday gift for my son and it worked for less than two weeks. It was a huge disappointment.\"\\nSplit at the seam making it unrepairable after only 2 weeks. Don\\'t waste your money.\\nJUNK\\nBox came damaged. Item was not new as described.\\npeeling color to clear .\\n\"Terribly annoying squeaker. We removed it, it was so irritating. And it\\'s really not great for jumping either. You\\'d might as well just jump up and down on the floor without it...you\\'ll get the same experience as if you WERE using it.\"\\nThe pictures do not match the item description. Not even close.\\nLucky if this thing shoots 75 yards.  Would love to have manufacturers show how they make a water balloon go 400 yards with this contraption\\n\"I bought this as a gift for a child.  His parents called to tell me that they cannot use it because it is in French.  Boy was I embarrassed.  Their child and his parents speak English.  No where in your description did it say that this was in French.  Presently, it is occupying space in my closet.  My hard earned money went to waste.  Going forward, I suggest you inform potential buyers that it is in French to avoid disappointment, embarrassment, and money going down the drain.\"\\nThe game itself was fine... I was just short a puck! ;(\\nLasted only a few hours before popping.\\nCompletely misleading and overpriced for what you\\'re paying for. Waste of money\\nNo instructions to convert to English usless\\nSame as info on the jump o lens I flat able bouncer.  I was going to return both but felt it was too much money to be waste returning it.\\nFake figure and bad quality which made in China without an accessory box!\\n\"Made from inferior material. two broke while inflating, the other two lost air after a short period of time. Not worth the material it\\'s made of.\"\\nWas defective when it arrived. It couldn\\'t be inflated because there was already a hole.\\n\"Only giving 1 star because I can\\'t give 0 (or negative). Within 5 minutes of use, we noticed a small leak. Ten minutes later, that small leak was larger than my thumb, and our weekend of floating turned into an early exit of the river as I cut my foot trying to pull the deflated tube out of the water. We tried using flex seal (I don\\'t recommend this, but it was all we had) and it worked for about 2 seconds. So basically, I highly recommend this item if you\\'re looking for a loss of $50, a nasty cut on the foot trying to save your purchase, and about 5 minutes of &#34;fun&#34;.  Also, many of our friends had tubes from this same company. They were purchased last year, used once, and half of them were patched up. Just stay away from this company... I think their business model centers on 0-1 use floats so you have to buy another the next year.\"\\nI do not recommend this product. We bought it for my son\\'s bday and the dart release button does not work. The lever is locked and the lever release button does not work either. So now we have a toy that my son hasn\\'t even got to play with because nothing works on it. I RECOMMEND NOT BUYING THIS. Very poorly made. :-(\\nDid not receive what is pictured. Received a regular find it cylindar. Only bought for the new shape.\\n\"I was so excited to give this to my daughter. As soon as we filled it with water, the tea pot leaked it all out! Maybe it was just my set, since it has positive reviews from others, but we\\'re returning it.\"\\nfell apart in less than a month\\nVery cheap\\nIt\\'s looks nice in the box but it\\'s very small ... it didn\\'t fit :-( .. i didn\\'t like it\\nArrived missing all of the hardware and half of the bedding. My nieces birthday is this weekend and now I have to go find something else for her\\nThe clip is too big for a tricycle which is what I wanted it for.  Returned.\\nThe paints dont show up and wear off in minutes. Cheap\\nToo small\\n\"Did not meet my expectations. Tiles are too narrow to stand on their  own but came without stands. The face card tiles are so similar in look that , in their smaller size, it\\'s hard to tell them apart. My other Rummicubes sets have used only numbers anyway, which I prefer, as it turns out.\"\\n\"I read the reviews and figured, how poorly made can it really be? Well, the first one we received had a red section didn\\'t work at all. We exchanged it and enjoyed a second one for a few weeks but now the little screen no longer functions so there is no record of what level you are on or the high score. I remembered the game from my childhood and wanted to share it with my son who I knew would enjoy it. I sure wish it lasted a little longer....bummer it lasted just long enough to be out of the window to be returned!\"\\ni dislike this so much i didnt send it back for it probably would cost to much so i just ate it ...when advertising this product you should let people know that you r receiving a disposable fuji freakin camera.\\nIt was too large and bulky which made it almost impossible to get on it.  The BLACK colored area got so hot from the sun that it was uncomfortable to the touch.\\nProduct broke within 3 weeks. Would not recommend.\\nQuality is ok but they sent one post that was longer than others\\nDid not work when we received it.  My son was so disappointed. We are returning the product.  Will let you know if we have any problems with the return.\\nFell apart after a few weeks.  Yarn unraveled from the mop and duster.  I thought it was so adorable and I knew my little one would love playing with it but unfortunately it didn\\'t last long.\\nThought this was a skull I could use as a hide habitat for my snake turns out it has no open holes anywhere on it it\\'s more of a decoration.\\n\"Son recieved as a birthday gift and after one hour of play, it stopped working all together. Reading other reviews this seems to be a common issue. It\\'s too bad because the toy is adirable and my 3 yr old loved it and is now very sad.\"\\nThey were way smaller than advertised!\\n\"Product came quickly. Arrived with bottle of fog in a bubble wrap envelope. No instructions or packaging.<br />I had seen the instructional video on youtube prior to purchase which was incredibly helpful, but showed things I didn\\'t get. Most notably, there was no syringe for the fog solution - so it was a huge pain to drip the solution into the tiny hole drop by drop. Literally.<br />Then I put in the batteries and pushed the trigger.  Several seconds later a few pitiful puffs of fog came out. Another 15 seconds, a few more pitiful puffs. I understand elements need to heat up, but I never got anything like the continuous stream shown in the video (which is what I expected, and wanted.) There\\'s no preheating like in a theatrical fogger, and eventually after holding down the trigger for any length of time and even keeping it on a flat, level surface, the thing just stopped puffing entirely.  Batteries were new, solution tank was full.... it recovered after I left it for awhile.<br />So... totally useless. This is something I would expect from the dollar store.  Apparently these units are hit or miss?  I see good reviews but mine is a total dud.\"\\ni got none of the stickers i was looking for . in the picture first one is a supreme sticker. not one supreme sticker in my bag\\nNot what I expected for the money I paid for this doll. The hair is horrible not even close to the picture.

I got a YJ GuanLong, (which you can buy for about 5$) not a AoLong. Still, this is a good cube. But it is NOT the AoLong, they can be bought for about 16 USD on at thecubicle.us. Don\\'t get this if you need an AoLong, because this isn\\'t one.\"\\nSO HEAVY!

Will give it to Toys for tots  next Christmas. Someone will be able to use it as a toy!t\\nI ordered this for my petit 2 year old granddaughter. The tube did not hold enough air to keep her head above water and was so small that she couldn\\'t maintain an upright position in the water. It was completely useless!!\\nSo bad smelling that we can\\'t use it\\n\"Seeing the little center panel for identifying the &#34;artist&#34; to wear the apron, it would have been really neat to have that funky-shaped panel be more &#34;squared up&#34; to slide a 4x6&#34; photo of the child doing some painting, or using markers. I\\'m a graphic designer and was able to cut a fine edge out of the top edge of the panel (only the acetate), and insert a photo with my grand daughter\\'s photo and her name (by ordering a 5x7&#34; print and trimming it down.) What a headache and wished there would have been a simpler way.\"\\nbacks open way too easily\\n\"Super cheap, lame toy. The body of the butterfly broke off quickly and the glitter started peeling off too. And just like others said, it randomly rings when no one is around. We took the batteries out and missed the return window by 3 days. Bummer.\"\\n\"This guard could not possibly fit on my \\'copter. I don\\'t know what it is designed to fit, but neither of my \\'copters could possible fit it.\"\\n\"Returned this item because it was too tight on my sons wrist, he is a really small wrist and it was way too tight. It worked good but they need to make an adjustment on the band.\"\\nThe necklaces did not have rainbow beads. They were either a pink necklace or a purple necklace.\\n\"Kids love this.  Parents hate it.  If you have a light sleeper, don\\'t expect this to help.  It has a 45 minute timer, so my son woke every 45 minutes crying to have it turned on again.  All.  Night. Long.  We went through the ordeal of taking it away, and now our son sleeps much better.\"\\nDidn\\'t even come.  Total theft\\nIt\\'s cute for a dollhouse.\\n\"Honestly the biggest rip off ever, you are better off buying bulk random cards, every booster was almost identical and there were no planeswalkers whatsoever, really lame that some of the booster packs had up to 3 cards that were only advertisement and not to mention there were no mythics either\"\\nThe plastic is not sturdy. Purchased them to use as therapy for my son but he twisted then right off and now they don\\'t return to position.\\n\"If there was a ZERO STARS this would get it.  The design is great in concept, but in practice, the &#34;Connect&#34; straps ripped right through the tubes less than 5 minutes in - we lost 6 out of 10 that we tried connecting togather - POOR design, the straps are hot welded (read glued with heat) to the side of the tubes, which probably does help the integrity and causes the strap to rip the tube before the strap itself would ever fail.<br /><br />These should not be marketed at &#34;River Run&#34; lounges - they are nice lunges, but seem to be marketed horribly, best bet: sit hem in your pool in nice calm water.\"\\nBox was badly damaged. We were very afraid it was missing pieces but took the risk since our son\\'s birthday was in a few days.\\nBad box.\\n\"Never buy this product.  It over heated and caused a house fire in my home with over $30,000 worth of damage.  The fire inspector said to never charge a battery with this cord unless it is in a bucket of sand.\"\\n\"So far, it does not work at all.  We\\'re still trying to figure out what\\'s wrong.  Will probably return it if we don\\'t get it to work.  My grandson was very disappointed in his birthday gift.\"\\nDon\\'t believe the picture. You are going to receive a something that is nothing like what you\\'re seeing.\\nDoesn\\'t work. You can hardly see the screen. Poorly made.\\nIt is a cheap tablecloth material. A definite waste of money. Part of it was frayed. It is supposed to be made of polyester but is just nylon taffeta. Not even remotely what I was looking for.\\n\"Absolutely atrocious. You could get five crayola crayons for the quality of this whole set. The crayons write like rocks dipped in paint, the oil pastels are just cheap crayons, water colors are cheap, paint brush has three bristles on it; even the paper is cheap. Extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing is big and bulky. The markers are the only thing that are half decent.\"\\nwas broken when I opened the package.\\n\"I would give zero stars if I could. Horrible! Doesn\\'t work at all.

Unfortunately I bought the set over 30 days ago, and amazon will not allow me to return the item.\"\\nThis expensive helicopter broke during the 1st use\\n\"We ordered this last month as my 7 year old son wanted a remote controlled Ferrari red car. We live in UAE, as the delivery is not available in this country, we got this delivered to our relative in Dallas and then they delivered us to Dubai. Open opening the entire packing, it looked awesome, my son was very happy and excited to play with his new birthday gift. We put the battery on charge for couple of hours before we could use it. But unfortunately it never worked, there may be some problem either with the batteries or charger, they wont charge, even after leaving it for several hours on charge again. This whole set it just lying like that in the corner of his room as a display, sadly he could not play with it even once. He as well us we are very disappointed.\"\\nIt is a very cute costume dress.  The stitching on the back pulled right away and it has a huge hole down the seam.  Will have to sew it back up.

My husband had trouble with it.  It says it comes with a hole punch - not in package.  Doesn\\'t seem like it will work.  Tried to return it, but missed the cut off my 1 week - we hadn\\'t tried to do it until today. Didn\\'t realize there was a 30 day policy. Amazon is usually better then that.  I thought something by Smithsonian would be good.  Don\\'t buy it.\"\\nThis sucked! The tiny bibles clump together and fall to the ground!\\n\"This puzzle will randomly make loud noises when the pieces are not in place -- but not until hours after anyone has touched it.  If you have misplaced a piece or put away toys too quickly and bumped a piece out of the puzzle and it is kept in a room where you child is sleeping, a incredibly loud siren will go off at random intervals throughout the night, waking up your child and torturing you.  There is no on/off switch, so you have to find the thing while your startled child screams, sirens blazing, find a screwdriver and unscrew the battery cover to stop the sirens.  My husband thought it would be easier to throw the darn thing away but I was worried the poor garbage man would get into a wreck.\"\\nIt didn\\'t work right and was returned\\n\"the mother f***** didn\\'t work, I really wanted that boat\"\\nCash drawer won\\'t open without an adult prying it open.

Today which is August 24th, I was going to send it back to Amazon and it came up I could only send it back up to August 1,2015. This dress in JUNK. Please do not spend your money on it. Another word of advice, do not buy gifts that you don\\'t intend to give right away from AMAZON due to their return policy.

The connection to the hose sprayed more water than the tunnel.  There was a tear in the one side wall of the slide, and there was a hole in the one footing of the tunnel that let the water out.

Maybe mine was defective or something or these reviews are fake but it doesn\\'t work at up it backs up goes forward stops randomly my son use to get frustrated and cry so I took it away and has been sitting in a closet for months 😒\\n\"No, most of the balls that I received had holes in them.\"\\n\"We bought this  for Easter, after I got it I realized I went overboard and ended up saving it for a day when my girls were extra well behaved and deserved a fun reward. We got this out today, played it for an hour before the letter pad stopped working. We were having a great time and it would have been a great learning toy if it hadn\\'t broken right away :( we tried replacing batteries and nothing worked\"\\nIt was much smaller in size than what was portrayed.\\n\"Gave this to my Grandson for his birthday, the gun trigger does not work, when the gun is loaded and cocked it automatically fires without the trigger being pulled. Based on the description of the gun I don\\'t think this is how it is supposed to function.\"\\nThis isn\\'t the classic game. The pieces are bigger and the openings are much wider and the cards that tell you what part to remove are not included.\\nGarbage\\n\"The board is really cheaply made. It probably costs them $1 to manufacture this pos. Not a nice product at all, these reviews must be fake...\"\\n\"My daughter was very excited to pick out her new backpack. She was thrilled to find her favorite Inside Out characters on a pack. We are disappointed to report that the quality of the backpack was not what we antipated-the zipper broke on the first day of use, the zipper on the lunch bag is difficult to use, and the clasp to hold the lunch bag to the pack was poorly stitched (unable to hold the bag-we had to remove)\"\\n\"I wish I could give this purchase a ZERO star! The boat does not look like the one pictured. The motor does not work and the once we put it in the water it flipped over and sunk to the bottom of the tub. My little one was completely disappointed, as was I! Unfortunately I did not read the other reviews before purchasing this, or else I would have seen that every other person has had the same same issue! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Waste of time and money!!!\"\\n\"I ordered this headset for my granddaughter for her birthday, so she could take it with her on the airplane to Disney World today.  Well, IT DIDN\\'T WORK.  Piece of junk.  My three-year-old granddaughter was so disappointed.  When I checked the order, Amazon\\'s return policy is for a month, which expired YESTERDAY.  This is a defective product and Amazon should see to it that a replacement is sent ASAP.\"\\n\"Very cheap materials.  Instructions poorly done, resulting in a miscue which literally prevented the completion of assembly (attached the wheels to the axl before attaching the axl hub to the chassis).  Once the wheel nuts are on, they can\\'t be removed without destroying the wheel or cutting the axl in half.  Will try to cut the wheel off and use one of the trailer wheels in its place.\"\\n\"Buy these 2 stuff. Weeks later, mail from China only contains one piece of plastic balloon. That\\'s right just one piece of balloon.\"\\nThis toy doesn\\'t work appropriately - the truck doesn\\'t seem to weigh enough to press down the buttons that initiate the launching of the truck. Returning.\\nFeels and looks cheap. There is brown fur along the seams on its white legs and the mouth is not symmetric.  I returned this without hesitation. Hopefully they will listen to these complaints and will make better quality toy.\\nMine came already defected . The idea is good but the quality scarce.\\nIt was fun while it lasted. We played with it twice before it stopped pumping. Don\\'t waist your money.\\nOn first time use water pressure very low raise a little more water pressure and didn\\'t take long for water to rise then pop one of the front of the slide busted not happy but my grandkids had fun for a couple of hours\\nThought it made sounds. It doesn\\'t.\\nThis is terrible. Very misleading description. I thought I was purchasing a die cast vehicle that would complete my son\\'s smoke jumper collection. This is cheap spray painted plastic and only about two inches in size.\\n\"The product worked out of the box for maybe 5 minutes.  The second time we tried to use it, the motor was running but was not producing any bubbles.\"\\n\"garbage, doesnt even open all the way on its own.\"\\nGames last on average one single card play\\n\"My order came today earlier than expected , And I thought everything was find until i looked close and did some research and saw that this figure was fake , It looks like a real levi figma but its not , All the pieces came but some essential packaging and other things were missing including instructions . The figure itself is loose on some parts .\"\\n\"This car is pretty cool as remote control cars go.  I purchased this at a local toy shop with a great return policy.  Within 60 days, just as another reviewer also said, it wouldn\\'t go forward or backward anymore, only turn around and around.  Fortunately they took it back no questions asked.  The second car has lasted about another month and today the remote control has completely stopped working.  Excellent concept, poor product quality.\"\\nTook forever to be delivered. Badly painted. Disappointment all around.\\n\"Like someone else said, impossible to not break something.<br /><br />Don\\'t buy this cheap thing\"\\nI got this For my nephew and it came broken there was no bow .. Not happy with this product at all .. I want my money back.\\nThe car is really slick other than the fact that it has a screw issue so I couldn\\'t get it out of the Styrofoam without breaking it...\\nI have no complains about the product but the service associated sucks big time. I am buying couple of toys from VTECH  so i ordered this one with another VTECH toy. Both of them are pretty close and same and i decided to return it but the return shipping is almost $7 for an item worth $19.<br />That is horrible when AMAZON is selling it itself.  This item is more suitable for kids who can answers questions. If your kid is smart enough to find or to understand the questions then it is good. It doesn\\'t have rhymes in it and it is very small. So i would prefer for 5+ years only no less than that.<br />However one star is for the service rather than the product. The product should be good for 5+ years only.\\nFell apart after several years of use.\\nGreat rc! Horrible charger wires not connected out of package. Please send another charger.\\n\"The 2&#34; toy is fine, why is cost $17 is insane.\"\\nCame with a hole in it.\\n\"Was given as a gift. No sunshade included! Box says one was included, but not there!!\"\\nTried four different sets of ants and they all died. Very disappointed.\\nJunk\\nthe music its not clear.\\nWas not the American package\\nThe first one did not work at all. The second one was not compatible with US electric outlets.\\nVery poor quality. Returning product for one I saw at Costco.\\n\"Cheap, cheap,body parts broke immediately upon playing with them\"\\nI was so excited to out this puzzle together but I realized that it is missing  a piece! I cannot complete my puzzle without it. I hope the company can send it to me so I can complete it!\\nCorrect me if I am wrong but based on this coin being 14 mgs(not grams) it is worth 75 cents.  You are better off buying a Snickers bar.  It will taste better than the bad taste in your mouth after someone tells you that it is worthless.\\n\"This is the first time it has ever happened to me when buying direct from Amazon, but this product was used. There was a human hair completely wrapped around on of the propeller motors, and all of the props were scratched up. The unit does come with a second set that I used to  replace the first and it ultimately worked, but this is still unacceptable. As far as a mini drone, it drifts a lot and is not easy to fly. This model also does not have the protective rails like some of the other similarly-priced models from the same manufacturer, so the blades are completely exposed - not safe for kids.\"\\n\"Title, pictures, and description are very misleading. Says &#34;set of decorations&#34;; &#34;set&#34; implies more than one, decorationS (as in plural) also implies one than one. However, I reviewed 1 squirt figure. When I called about the other 3 in the set, I was told the listing was for 1 figure, not a &#34;set&#34; of the 4.\"\\nVery cheap.\\n\"I purchased this item because I find the full-size Sequence game excellent. The travel version is USELESS.  There is only one card of each kind, which makes it almost impossible for either player to win, and there is absolutely no strategy involved. I would NOT RECOMMEND this game.\"\\nit should have been negative because that is what he\\'s been worth to our economy. NOTHING\\nSearching for children\\'s toys and this comes up? Really?!\\nCame with head broke off.. Terrible packaging as well!! Very disappointed!!\\n\"I did not receive the pirate fairies, I got the fairies from secret of the wings.\"\\nIt took less than 20 minutes before I realized it was hopeless for me to even think about helping my granddaughter assemble this kit. The directions were non-existent--we were supposed to follow the photos which were unclear--and the pieces were flimsy and unstable. My granddaughter ended up creating a magic wand instead of a roller coaster. What a terrible disappointment!\\n\"(Posted by Lea Ann\\'s husband Ed)<br />This gets a 5 star review from my 4 year old grandson because loves having a sandbox with shade. (PERIOD!).<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: As for the rest, only ONE STAR!  I anticipate this thing will only make it through the summer (and it is then end of August now!)then it\\'s to the burn pile with it. The wood pieces were very light weight, warped & twisted. The hinge screws were only in 3/4th the way and in sideways, I had to remove them and re-screw them in. The hinges were bent. The cloth cover is supposed to be held on by 2\\'\\' Velcro strips several inches apart, except that no matter which way you lay the material on the roof slats, they DO NOT match up AND the panel is narrower then the roof slats. I ended up using 1/2\\'\\' staples to attach the roof cloth and had to stretch the material tight to get it to reach both sides. I am a carpenter so I was able to make it work but the typical homeowner/grandparent would be pulling their hair out.<br /><br />PACKAGING: This thing was pack with foam strips that disintegrate during shipping. The tiny foam pieces stick to every inch of the wood with static electricity. Be prepared for a big mess cleanup and pray the wind isn\\'t blowing the wrong way.<br /><br />My advice, buy it if you have money you\\'d like to waste and are willing to fix it right out of the box.\"\\nThis product is tiny and adorable but the sewing and coloring is awful. Coloring is definitely splotchy and not a solid color the points on the head are poorly sewn and can see hot glue!<br />... Definitely poorly made.\\nOurs did not work at all.Made a few noises but nothing ever came out. Going to try to send it back. So disappointed. 5 year old grandson was so excited to play this but it was a dud!😞\\nBuyer Beware!  I bought this along with several books.  Spent over $100.  The warranty is only good for 3 months and it broke after 5 months.  Read the reviews online before buying.\\nI didn\\'t think they had a good scent...\\n\"I bought this for a kindergartener.  After one year, the lining between compartments ripped, the zipper slabs broke off, and the plastic tabs on one of the straps broke.  I was able to stretch it out to two years, but was hoping it would last longer, given the good reviews.\"\\n\"I never worked , very bad product.\"\\n\"I bought this for my son\\'s 4th birthday and it worked perfectly for two weeks!  Then, for some reason, the voice mechanism began to sound muffled and hollow!  And,...the laser light on the arm stopped working consistently!  What a costly disappointment!  I wish I could return it but my son would be heartbroken!\"\\n\"The rim broke after one use with the kids\\' friends over. I know it\\'s meant to break away, but now it won\\'t go all the way back up and breaks away with every basket. Worthless.\"\\nNot at all like picture. .only one tray. ..very disappointed. .\\n\"really small, but then again did not pay much, really hard to play with even for tiny hands, would not recumbent this bundle\"\\n\"Junk- falling apart, doesn\\'t stay upright\"\\n\"First impression: loved. Good size, different from other stress balls with the hard beads<br />Second impression: disappointment. Bought this at the end of June, received it first week of July, it is mid August and I had to throw it away....unused. The rubber outside cracked and deteriorated so the beads could fall out easy.<br />I am a teacher and I bought this for my sped kids and they never got to use it...I\\'m afraid to buy another...\"\\n\"Don\\'t waste your money. I bought this at the beginning of August, my kids have used it 3 times, and here we are today and the top ring won\\'t stay inflated. It\\'s complete junk because we don\\'t let the kids bounce on it or anything.\"\\nbroke within a week.  Green stopped lighting up and the other colors soon followed.\\n\"They aren\\'t reusable. I have rubbed them on my hair, the kids hair ....they don\\'t work twice. Which makes this a very expensive box of stickers. Boo : (\"\\nThese fell apart before I could give the trike to my granddaughter.  It would have cost more to return them than to just throw out.\\n\"Got the package, doesn\\'t work at all!\"\\n\"Paid $1 for this at Dollar Tree, didn\\'t work from the get-go.\"\\n\"I love Melissa and Doug, but this is the first product of theirs that I am severely disappointed with.  The sliding doors immediately fell off their tracks and will never stay on.  My 3 year old almost never plays with it.  I would return it if I could.  Instead I will probably donate it soon.  So sad, because my daughter LOVES horses and I thought she would adore this little barn.  The horses that came with it were also extremely cheap - obviously glued together and couldn\\'t even stand up on their own.  Terrible product, and I don\\'t expect that from M&D.\"\\n\"These are tiny miserable pieces of plastic which,when vigorously shaken, may emit just enough light to be seen in your hand if it is very dark. One or two are bright enough to be seen from a few yards away. The brightness is very low, and inconsistent from stick to stick. I tried these and bought cyalume instead.\"\\nReally disappointing. Cheaply made.\\nMy debit card number was stolen and used fraudulently after I bought these and they were the only things I had used my debit card to buy that week.  Had to change my card number and it was a huge hassle.\\n\"Was suggested this for my Autistic son. He opened the box and I thought it strange he didn\\'t have to undo any tape or anything. When I read the box it even said a parent needed to undo it. I should have known right there.... it had been opened and sent back once already. It didn\\'t work - no music. When I went to repurchase, low and behold it had been the last one. I can\\'t believe they would re-shelve and then resell something broken. My kiddo was heartbroken.\"\\n\"I bought one and returned it because it never turned on. The battery pack was not the correct size, and one of the batteries was not making contact. I returned it and bought another one. I had the same problem. It wouldn\\'t turn on and upon checking the batteries again, one of the batteries wasn\\'t making contact. The design is poor.\"\\nNot what I expected. The diamonds are tiny.\\n\"I ordered this chess set for a vertical chess board I am building. I saw 7 inch king sets elsewhwere which would have made the board to long for the space I have. I measured for a 6 inch king and it fit perfect for the wall space. PROS - I got the set in a reasonable time, the pieces look good CONS  - the king was ONLY 5 INCES TALL!!!! I have emailed seller and no response. I will provide another update on my situation when I hear back. In all fairness I have not returned the set just yet, I may adjust my builid to make  a 5 inch king will work with the wall but my point is I ordered a 6 inch king set which is what I expected and  paid for based on what was advertised and it is NOT what I got.\"\\n\"Very poor quality!  Pieces broken upon arrival, paint messy on each character\"\\n\"Product got stuck to the wrap, and had some of the label stuck to it. did not turn and it\\'s just a lame product in general. Expected more of it . or at least to look bigger and in much better quality. Fell on the floor one time and chipped . would not recommend it to anyone.\"\\n\"product did not work, poor design\"\\nHorrible! Sizes are not accurate\\n\"I purchased this robot from www.robotshop.com, assembled it, turned it on and then attempted to take it through it\\'s calibration. Nothing! I then went back through all of the servos to double-check the connections and everything was perfect. I promptly sent www.robotshop.com an email requesting assistance and they responded back to me about three weeks later. Their response was a forwarded message from the manufacturer &#34;dongbu&#34;, which essentially stated that I needed to check the servo connection, which I did, and run the &#34;HerkuleX&#34; software, which won\\'t install on my Windows 7, 64-bit computer. After spending over $1,000.00 for this robot, I expected the customer service experience, from both www.robotshop.com and &#34;dongbu&#34;, to be more substantial. I sent the www.robotshop.com and &#34;dongbu&#34; an email requesting a unit that is functioning properly. I\\'ll update this review appropriately based upon their response. I\\'ve copy/pasted my email to both companies, if you would like to read it.<br /><br />MESSAGE:<br /><br />Hello Sébastien,<br /><br />I was quite methodical on how I constructed this robot. Furthermore, I am positive that all servos, etc. were connected and secure. Nonetheless, I have audited each one manually and have concluded that this robot is defective. To me it appears to be either a battery or CPU issue.<br /><br />As an aside, when I purchased this robot from your website, your advertisement led me to believe that I would be receiving a robot that used a U.S. plug. The robot I was shipped appears to have an Asian or European plug. NOTE: The assembly document warns against using converter plugs, etc. In terms of the HerkuleX Manager software, when I attempt to install the software, I receive an error message. I have attached a screenshot of the error message. Is this software compliant with Windows 7, 64-bit? If not, please advice.<br /><br />Sébastien, I am exceedingly busy and frustrated with my purchase and have already invested way too much time and effort into this challenge. What\\'s more I have a son who needs this robot for his engineering class. I would like to have this robot exchanged for another one that is fully assembled, audited for defects and completely operational, prior to being sent to out me. I will of course pay for the assembly. Please advice how you would like to receive this robot.<br /><br />Kind Regards,\"\\nBiggest waste of money ever. My granddaughter was very disappointed. The packages cost around $7 each and the cookie mix gives you the equivalent of maybe a half a cookie. In order to make cupcakes you have to buy another kit!  My 8 year old granddaughter wanted to return it but since it was a gift I missed the 30 day return. Would give if a zero star if there was that rating\\nThis is partially my fault but I was very disappointed in this order. The picture is very missleading. I assumed there was 6 buzzers to an order for the $9 being charged. But was suprised and disappointed when there was only one. I recommend you read the description and not as unexpected like I did. I would never have paid $9 for one very  small plastic buzzer.\\nTerrible! Terrible picture quality! It\\'s really smaller than I imagined and sooooo cheap! Do not buy!!!\\n\"very disappointed with quality and the picture is not a true representation - the \\'skirt\\' does not exist, the head piece is not full as shown - just flat material and the workmanship is poor\"\\n\"Poor,poor quality. The side of the book bag is sewn to the back not allowing it to expand. Because of this I can\\'t even put his binders in it. I wasted my money! It\\'s useless!

The slightest breeze made it impossible to catch a full bubble. Horrible taste in mouth after blown nag bubbles. Will keep trying. Lots left in bottle.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t recommend this at all, i bought 2 of these and both fail a range test with my DX8 at 20-40 feet a far cry from the 90 feet it should perform at. the final straw for me was when I nearly lost my cub at only about 100 or so yards away.  Spend the extra money and get a genuine spektrum receiver. It\\'s much less than a new airplane.\"\\nThe item was listed as 100% complete and was missing a large part to the game making it not usable. It had to be returned.\\nThis &#34;dresser&#34; is terrible and was returned the next day.  It might work to store toys in but it would not hold clothes because it is really just two shelves.\\n\"Purchased this product because it is a similar design to one I had previously. The 2 I purchased were smaller than the original, but still of good size. Both of them were ruined within 2 or 3 uses... with no more stress placed on product than by an average adult hopping into it to lounge on. They both tore at the seat/tube interface and quickly lost air. Irreparable. NO durability! Inferior product.\"\\n\"Failed to work, V Tech has always been a good quality until now.\"\\nNot at all what I expected.\\n\"Like many buyers, I supported this on Kickstarter - I am the model for Shady Captain in the game.  Three years after paying, my Collector copy of the game still has not arrived, I was sent a copy of the next level down.  No idea when my proper copy will arrive, Liz does not answer questions.<br />It\\'s a very pretty game - box, pieces, cards, all very lovely.  Unfortunately, the rules and gameplay are not so lovely.  There are massive amounts of downtime, and the nature of the game means that you cannot plan your next move until everyone else has finished their turns, which means that in a four player game it can easily be five minutes of you watching other people deliberate what cards to buy.<br />When it IS your turn, 90% of actions are a simple &#34;add up my blue/green points - if they beat the monster total, I win&#34;.  So next to no tactics, just a long slog to the finish.  In the three games I\\'ve played, although it would have been possible to stop the leader from winning, in every game the other players decided to let them win, just to get the game over with.<br /><br />This is a game that I am actually in - I\\'m on one of the cards in every copy of the game! - but it\\'s such a poor gaming experience I still don\\'t want to bring it to the table.  Very pretty, everyone will gasp when you put it on the table....but they will be yawning by the time they finish playing.  Avoid.\"\\n\"The flashing only works when I hold in the button inside the it.  As soon as I let it go, the flashing stops.  I sent an email to the shipper via Amazon, but I haven\\'t heard back.  For a flashing Fedora, this doesn\\'t work.  Hopefully it can be replaced without additional cost.\"\\nIt doesn\\'t glow in the dark and it is very runny and messy.

To add insult to injury my daughter grabbed one of the baby bottles, and the plastic at top was not cut correctly in production and she scratched herself. If you are looking for a good mix of very small pieces to what is shown on top then this would be a good box, but if you are looking for more of a variety of what is shown on top, do not buy this box.  I will throw several of the very tiny pieces away as they are useless to anyone.  There are MANY variety party boxes on amazon that have a better quality mix then this box. (esp. if you are looking for any of the boxes with tiny tiny pieces, not to mention a lot cheaper) When able too, i will post photos of the small pieces to show how much worthless junk you get. Skip buying this box, and look further on Amazon.\"\\nVery disappointed because the launch system pictured is not the launch system that comes in the package. I returned mine... Waste of time\\nNo...not very practical when the kids start building. The pieces are smashed together and break projects and the edges do not lay that flat if you are thinking about dragging an existing project on there.

He put it together by himself, and then was very frustrated that it wouldn\\'t work, despite putting together properly.  We verified he had done it right (it is super straight forward), and it won\\'t do anything.  Reviews elsewhere seem to show this is a worthless toy, that maybe if you wander around, you might get one station to briefly come in.  There is also no educational angle on this toy; it doesn\\'t have any science lesson or learning aspect.  SAVE YOURSELF THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND MONEY, AND DON\\'T BUY THIS.\"\\nFlimsy construction.

My 5 year old son had been asking for one of these since he first saw the commercials. He got two for his birthday and was super excited. We blew the first one up during his party and he literally played with it for less than 10 minutes before it popped. A partygoer barely touched it with his hands and the thing disintegrated. Needless to say, my son cried, the partygoer felt terrible, and the ball was ruined. So, we move onto the second ball he received, he played with it for a few minutes and then left it alone. About a half hour later, I hear a \\\\\\\\\"\"POOF\\\\\\\\\"\" and investigate and see that the second ball is popped now, too! The ball was laying on the inside of a tent and there was nothing around it to have caused it to pop. Horrible product and a waste of money. If you like watching kids cry, this is a great product for you. Otherwise, it\\'s bulls***.\"\\n\"Does nothing but, make a mess.I put the cubes in the freezer for 8 hours.

Just add a drink and, 2 cups of ice cubes and, mix. When I was shaking this, The drink leaked everywhere even on my clothes.\"\\n\"As has already been noted, there are not 100 different colors, but 25 colors X 4 sets.  Actually, my set only had 99 pencils, and quite a few of the leads were already broken.  The wood is the cheap kind that is splintery and the lead breaks while sharpening, so by the time you have a usable pencil  you\\'ve sharpened through about half of an inch of wood.  The colors are not dark, no matter how hard you press.  The lead seems to be mixed with something that doesn\\'t let the color through.  Save your money and get Crayola or RoseArt or anything else, really.  The only good thing about these is the case - not ideal, but a good place to store my other pencils for easier access than the box they came in.\"\\nIt was missing pieces (Ernies head) big dissapointment. It was a gift for my son.\\n\"I purchased the Mega Bloks Caterpillar dump truck along with this one and I must say, this item was beyond disappointing. It\\'s extremely cheaply made and quite flimsy.

The bed of the truck pops up and smacked my son right in the face when he put his hand on the back part of the bed and the edges of the plastic are somewhat thin and sharp.\"\\nDo not buy. Does not work as promised. My son is 2 years old and fell off of it twice. Could not stay together.\\n\"This isn\\'t for a KK2 board, it comes with a 10-pin connector on both ends. It won\\'t even fit on the KK2 board.\"\\nNice size pool for little ones. Pool didn\\'t last long though. Seam burst open second day. Pool unusable. Amazon sent new one next day. Great customer service. New one loses air when filled. Not happy having to fill with air constantly.  Water inevitably empties when refilling with air.\\nThe handle on the reel broke off the first time<br />I used this reel. The kite I used was a large kite<br />And the winds were 15-18 mph.<br />I would have hoped the reel would have held up but it didn\\'t. I\\'m going to have to look elsewhere for a good reel\\nWe purchased this for Christmas and 8 months later it has holes in it and is NOT holding up. Very disappointing\\nNot worth it. The quality of the bag is awful! You can see they tried to make the bag and messed up and just added another layer on top of the photo.\\nDogs hated it. Looks creepy.\\n\"The fur color seems to have a green tint to it. It\\'s pretty subtle, but enough that his nickname is Green Dog.\"\\n\"Very cheap, don\\'t fit my Cheerson CX-10 as advertised. The protector was fine, the props suck----bad.\"\\nThese are not 12 inches as described-- they are more like 6.\\n\"Eyebrows are such a personal thing, I don\\'t think there\\'s a &#34;one size fits all&#34; solution. These didn\\'t work for me.\"\\nLasted 5 minutes\\n\"I hate Agricola! I feel that it is hard to learn all of the mechanics, it is a very complicated game with very little pay off. They\\'re entirely too many rounds and the gameplay takes forever. The best part are the cute little meeple  but that does not save the game from being hellaciously boring. I game a lot but refused to play this one it just never ends.\"\\ndidn\\'t like it\\n\"It took us a while each night to finally get the very small pieces together for what I thought wold be a excellent puzzle for framing. Well, it is missing about 5 pieces from nearly the middle of the puzzle. So, now it is too late to return it and I can not use it, so it has been a waste of time and money spent.\"\\n\"First of all, if something is labelled that it\\'s for 8 year olds (and up) then 8 year olds should be able to follow the directions and complete the steps on their own. This is NOT the case with this kit. My very capable daughter and her friend needed so much help and supervision (as others have said--anything that the ingredients touch basically are ruined) that it was not fun at all for them. Secondly, the gum that this thing creates is &#34;DISGUSTING.&#34; This is a direct quote from both kids who immediately spit out every flavor they made and ran to wash out their mouths. They threw the whole set away and grabbed some pre-bought gum to get rid of the gross taste of their concoctions. Thankfully we had used throwaway bowls, cups, spoons, etc. and did this outside on the deck because otherwise I\\'d also be throwing out my dishware!\"\\n\"Horrible product. Strings broke within the first five minutes of it being out of the box. Cannot tighten strings and the tuners all broke off as well. Wasn\\'t looking for perfection with this, just something my four year old could play with, but she never even got a chance to.\"\\nI did not receive my doll. Only the box.\\n\"One battery was good, one battery was bad. Guess you get what you pay for 😩\"\\nPaint was chipped off on face had to return\\n\"Total piece of junk.  The problem is not building the projects, it is finding the parts.  I would. think they all related parts would be in the same bags. I spent more time trying to find parts than putting the projects together.  I compare lego mindstorm to those grab bag of parts  ads you find in the back of electronic magazines. I guess I was fooled by all the hype, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  I once thought that  using lego windstorm would make a nice robotics competition for school kids not anymore.\"\\nBought this for a gift. How embarrassing. It was a piece of junk. It was on the flooring and picked up the paint off the concrete. It is awful and would encourage other people not to buy it.\\nI just ordered 100 of these for my daughter\\'s birthday party at a Splash pad. They came in the mail today and they are NOT 6&#34;. It\\'s a stretch to call them 4&#34; even whether inflated or not--they are closer to 3&#34;. They are very tiny and are not what I ordered. I am very disappointed in the dishonest description of these beach balls.\\n\"If this worked for more than 4 days this quad would have a full 5 stars. Since the quality is such that it still flys, but fails to maintain any lift or control, I have to give it one star. I would love to get it replaced, but from the other comments it doesn\\'t look too easy. So, it was fun while it lasted. I was not rough with the little bug at all; but seeing that it\\'s a &#34;beginner&#34; quad, I would have expected it to last at least a week before going bad.<br /><br />BTW mine was white. Didn\\'t mind that but just throwing it out there.\"\\nI give this only one star because the description should have clearly stated that you need to own a specific transmitter. Not just any transmitter but one that can bind with the copter. I still plan the buy the transmitter and fly this but feel I was deceived. If you do not own the Spektrum DX6i 6 Channel then this will be a 300 dollar buy for you.\\nIt was a terrible waste of money. Two strings broke within an hour. And they were not over tightened. It is flimsy and has poor tune in the strings that work. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want to hang it on the wall as a decoration! My daughter was very disappointed.\\n\"This product has not lasted but a couple of months hence the reason for the one star.  It appears to be well made but It now has a leak, which can\\'t be repaired, and the flexible frame is broken, which can\\'t be repaired either.  You can\\'t use this float to lie on your stomach either.  I am disappointed as it was plenty big and floated me well.\"\\n\"Bought this to send to a little boy in Venezuela that has been dreaming of this toy for a few years now. After he received it found it he loved it so much he was sleeping with it. The parents did not want to tell me for awhile that the toy is broken, it leaks water from all over and does not shoot the water or something that it is suppose to do. I have no way to return this piece of junk to receive a refund so I would not recommend this item. Worst item I have ever gotten from using Amazon.\"\\nDifficult to understand directions. Not the game we played with friends.\\nNot work it\\nI got the cards. But 2 of the 4 cultivates I ordered were written on in Sharpie. I dont use my deck with protective sleeves so these cards are worthless. Thanks\\nIt does not even work\\n\"Well I bought this for a school diorama project.  The moss was difficult to work with and did not adhere well to the &#34;tree trunks&#34;.  The trunks were not particularly sturdy, and did not provide the scale we needed.  In fact the trees looked more like bushes.\"\\n\"For 40 bucks I\\'m not expecting great quality but I would expect, at least, for the case to close properly and for the label to not fall off the forst time you touch it.

I could not get air into it. Obviously a defect.  I threw it in the garbage.\\nI purchased this balloon for a Woodland Creature themed Baby shower and was very disappointed when I found out that it had a hole in the seam.  It would not hold the helium and was flat by the end of the shower.  Paid a considerable amount of money for the balloon & helium to fill it and it didn\\'t even last for one day.\\nLess than a year of light use and they broke beyond repair.\\n\"These are junk. After one pool day, they have lost their shape and the outer cover has started falling apart.\"\\n\"2nd plane, replaced the first after motor problems, and this one worked great for 1 full flight and same issue again. Attempted repair myself, but to no avail. Maybe I just received 2 bad ones, but will not order this plane again.

For $2 it would be a cute toy with no complaints but this is overpriced crap!\\nBuzz bomb. This thing buzzes even when not under load. I do NOT recommend.\\nVery cheap looking backpack. Definitely not worth the price that you pay. Does not come with a return label. Keep asking for a refund and return label but have not heard back and it\\'s been almost a week. Don\\'t buy this product. Not even worth the one star rate but it\\'s required for the post.\\n\"Bought these for school.  First time I wentto use them, the lids won\\'t snap shut.

I purchased this specific case for the mesh pocket that was supposed to be inside the lid.  Instead, I got a knock off case that did not have the pocket, it was not made by Ingenious, did not have their logo, does not include the 3 year warranty, and did not have the specified number of dividers.  The merchant changes the pictures and can change the description, but luckily, I have screen shots of what was advertised when I purchased this.  This was a gift and I elected to give it to the person instead of returning.  Very disappointed that I did not get the item that was described an it also did not match the pictures.

While the designer succeeded in his goal to create a satire game that lasts as long as an RPG session, it turns out to not be a good goal to pursue. A satire that is too long and slow is not fun. All the shortcomings of Munchkin without the zippy play.\"\\n\"This is the worst game ever!! I fired it directly into the trash about 3 days after receiving it. It did not hold my children\\'s attention for a nanosecond. They showed no interest in playing it. The Peppa Pig character does not spin upright. The game is way to complicated for a 3 year old as the packaging suggests. Basically, you\\'re paying over $22.00 for a Peppa pig spinning top that only spins on it\\'s side for about 4 seconds, because the character\\'s head slows it down when it scrapes against the pod or your floor. The top talks when it spins, but never completes what it is saying, because it must spin to speak. Halfway through Peppa\\'s sentence, she cuts off, because the top stops spinning. Wonderful, rush-to-market, engineering on this game. It felt very good firing this terrible game into the trash, or as they say in the UK, the rubbish bin. I fired it into the trash like a hot cup o\\' coffee!!\"\\nDisappointing\\nwrong size\\nThe product is no longer manufactured so if you buy one of these it\\'s most likely quite old.

It\\'s very disturbing to get the &#34;200&#34; used but &#34;clean&#34; legos. I ordered it for my son. It arrived, was sealed in a sandwich bag, counted 149 pieces total. About 25 bricks were big, the rest tiny pieces to fit one lego on top of another. About 15 of the larger sizes were either chewed, cut or destroyed. Almost every piece had some sort of gunk, gum or dried mud on it. Very disappointed in this. And I work for company who rents out legos monthly, at least we remove gunk and stuff off, give the pieces a good sanitized washing, and dried before being shipped out to the next customer.\"\\n\"This product is terrible, I returned it the next day.

When it falls over, it falls apart.  It is somewhat difficult to put together.  The cardboard pieces have small holes to connect them to the plastic parts.

They arrived fast, and I was so excited to open the package, but was perplexed at how small it was. Then I saw that these glow sticks are only 2 INCHES LONG. There was no way I was going to put 100 teensy weensy little skimmer pluggers in my pool, and they wouldn\\'t have lit it up enough to make a difference anyway. Very disappointed.<br /><br />I\\'m sure these little glow sticks can serve some fun purpose, but I can\\'t think of what it would be.\"\\nToo slow\\nDont buy.

Funny how scale was not mentioned in description.\\n\"They are made of very thin plastic and don\\'t jump like other thicker plastic frogs I purchased.  They just kind of mush down.

I got it out of nostalgia and to play it with our kids.  We were so excited to get it, but the disappointment rained off us in many ways.  Let me elucidate...<br /><br />1.  It is NOT the game you grew up with back in the 70s and 80s.  Not remotely.<br />2.  You no longer remove his spleen, kidney, ribs, heart, etc.  Now, you remove ridiculous items like a toilet, cell phone, bunch of grapes, a bird, and other such objects -- because, sure, that\\'s what you\\'d go in for surgery....right?<br />3.  The holes for the pieces are so large, there\\'s barely a challenge to get them out -- like in the old days.  Some pieces are rubbery and green, so as long as you can get a good grip on the smooshiness of it, you\\'ll get the piece out.<br />4.  There\\'s nothing more to the game than get the pieces out and you win.  No points, no cards (I remember cards with the original game direction you as to what pieces to remove) and the game was over in about 10 minutes with the three of us playing.<br />5.  No battery was included and you need a tiny screwdriver to remove the backing.  Come on...really?  You couldn\\'t add a battery in the box when there\\'s a big ad for Duracell right there?<br />6.  The plastic is flimsy and cheap.  Not sturdy like the one I had when I was a kid.<br /><br />Overall...just a total fail.  This game was made to dumb down an otherwise fun experience.  Do yourself a favor...bypass this and find a classic game on an online site.\"\\nNot a recommended as it doesn\\'t last long. Mine have a damage in the corners and don\\'t have any warranty. Useless piece now..\\nNo hair with figure\\n\"I found this spear to be utter garbage. I should have just taken my $10 and set it on fire. I no longer have the box, so it would be a hassle to package it up and send it back. First, the tip of the spear was bent because of how it was packaged. Second, there is a big split in the bamboo all down the side. Luckily I planned on hanging it on a wall so it can\\'t be seen. Third, the piece of bamboo has a pretty significant curve in it. I understand that is the nature of natural bamboo, but you\\'d think for an item you\\'re selling for $10 online you\\'d at least use straight pieces. Fourth, the &#34;feathers&#34; on the spear are a complete joke. I could find more substantial feathers in a down pillow.

She only did a few lessons, but complained at every single one and could not complete them independently.  This was very frustrating for her & deflated her self esteem.  It expects the student to come up with definition differences between things like &#34;intersect&#34; vs &#34;intersection&#34; without using a verb vs noun type of definition.  For example...  &#34;Immobile&#34; vs &#34;Immobility&#34; vs &#34;immovable&#34;- which definition goes with which word?  1- &#34;motionless, unable to move&#34; 2- &#34;unable to move or be moved, fixed&#34; 3- &#34;relating to the quality of not being able to move&#34;.  The student is expected to know the correct answer by being given the root &#34;mob, mot, mote, mov = Move&#34;, prefix &#34;im- = in, into, not&#34;, & suffixes &#34;-able = able to be&#34;, &#34;-ile = like, of, relating to&#34;, &#34;-ility = state, quality, act&#34;.

I repaired it, but on the 3rd flight the motor stopped again and I had a hard landing.  I tested it and discovered the Talon 90 ESC had stopped working.  I replaced it with a CC Edge HV 80 amp ESC and CC BEC Pro.  Heli flew good 3 times, but on the 4th flight the motor shut off again and I was forced to auto rotate with hard landing that broke the landing skids.  I inspected it after the hard landing, the radio receiver lights were on solid, the Gpro FBL unit had a solid green light, the ESC, BEC and battery were cool to the touch.  The motor felt pretty hot, but didn\\'t burn my fingers to touch it (sorry no temp gauge).  I tested it again and everything works.  I checked data on the ESC and the Amps are spiking pretty high at times.  The max for the final flight was 140.9 Amps with average 54.6.  I\\'m into this heli over $1500 and can\\'t trust the motor to keep running.  I think I might have a bad motor, but don\\'t want spend $180 on a new motor.

This came in a small white box. In other words, it is not a boxed gift. The box was white and had no label whatsoever. So if you are giving it as a gift, it looks like you assembled it and stuck it in a box. It LITERALLY looks like something you would get at the dollar store. The plastic is very VERY thin. The bug box is extremely small. If a two month old holds the net, they could snap it with one finger. All of the items are very small. Typically, bug &#34;houses&#34; are at least 10 inches across. This is really really small. I have no idea how they could ever possibly get away with charging $30 for this, let alone the $10.99 I paid. I rarely get things from Amazon that I sent back, unless they don\\'t fit, and this is absolutely getting sent back. I may pay $3 for this at Five Below, as a throw away gift, but this is absolute junk. I am guessing the other reviews were for a different version of this product.

These are by far the worst I have bought. After filling them every water ballon was losing water & shrinking within 5 seconds.

They are now greenish orange.<br /><br />I really like the way these look. From just a few feet away, they look like real band aids. My only problem is that the magnets are not strong. They really need to be on a completely flat surface and they have to be in the back of the car.<br /><br />I bought these for my son to put on my van to lessen the blow for my husband when he finally saw the damage. It worked! He laughed and wasn\\'t so mad. However, the bandaid on the front fender, where my mom backed into the van (it\\'s been a rough month for my poor vehicle) came right off when I hit 45 miles per hour. ):  I still look for it when I pass that spot.\"\\nThe figure for the poker chip set was deceptive.

I was extremely excited for this action figure but when I got it, I realized the paint looked really cheap and the material seems rather cheap and to top it off, it came with two left hands. The only plus is the mini action figure but alone, it wouldn´t be worth more than a few cents.\"\\n\"I ordered this, along with a couple others, for my dog. He loves the plush toys he can grab and sink his teeth into. The toy looks like it is well constructed but they sent the wrong size. The 8 inch birds are the perfect size for my dog.

Button batteries, when/if ingested (and with toddlers it\\'s only a matter of time) are life threatening to children, causing severe burns and often perforation to the esophagus and airway. I was appalled by this toy from the moment I opened the box. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Do not buy!\"\\nits not good. waste my money.\\n\"I have purchased several of these toys for my two Rottweilers, this one is terrible. It lasted about 2 seconds because it is two pieces. It detaches at the neck at the red bow tie. Both dogs had the head off in less than 1 min. The other ones that are one piece last a lot longer. My dogs love them. It is a great toy for exercise, they are exhausted after playing with them.

My 10 mo baby loves to play with the magnets on the frig so I ordered a magnet board and these magnets that I thought would be fun for us to play with together.  Well, forget that.  These magnets are too thin for little hands to be able to pick up.  He has no trouble picking up the refrigerator magnets . They are probably ok for a 3 or 4 yr old child, but not for a baby.  So when it says fun for your baby --- they aren\\'t.  They are cheap enough that it probably won\\'t pay to return them, so this will be a donation somewhere, since I won\\'t hold on to them for the next three years.  The sizes are fine, its just that they are soooooo thin.\"\\nMost figures came completely broken. Package looked like it had been opened and taped back up.

Also the price was reasonable, and they are Crayola and washable. So i was excited. I tried the red as soon as I got these and it left horrible streaks all over the board.

I bought theses ones because they were of normal coloring as apposed to the bright colored military men. I also wrote to the seller telling them of the poor quality with no response back.

We have experience with a lot of kids robot kits. I think this may have been a cheap knockoff. In any case, a waste of money. Plus, it took forever to arrive.\"\\nHorrible quality sleeves. Do not sleeve your magic cards in these they do not fit. Buy KMC instead.\\n\"I\\'m very disappointed in the condition I received this product in. The placeholder card, used for sorting cards in the box, was folded with a huge crease across it and peeling apart/frayed on the edges. You never would have seen something in that condition at an actual game store. I\\'ll be seeking a replacement or refund. The product itself is part of the Sentinels of the Multiverse game series, which, of course, is brilliant.

But this product is so bad that I think people should know and not purchase it. The fairy does not fly properly and is dangerous. When it is completely charged and button pressed the doll jumps out of the charger, sideways and very quickly, then bangs into wall or first thing it encounters.  The fairy does not hover.  She is also made out of very thin, cheap, and breakable plastic. I read many reviews after purchasing that said similar things. Do not buy. Your daughter will be very dissapointed.\"\\n\"We just recently received our Intex Dinosaur Inflatable Play pool and have used it a total of two times with 2 small children and two babies yet it has already broken.

The pieces are made of hard plastic that breaks easily. Some of the pieces arrived broken while others broke when I tried to separate the pieces that hadn\\'t been completely cut apart. As you try to put the puzzle together, nothing stays connected. You can never finish the puzzle because each new piece you connect causes the last piece you fit to come loose.\"\\n\"It said they would work with the F180. But they didn\\'t.

The hair is decent but the mask is extremely small as well as the netting that goes around the back of the head. My 7 year old couldn\\'t wear it at all.

YouTube this pool! It\\'s a disaster!!!\\n\"My 1 year old got this for his birthday in June. He loved it at first. But it soon stopped moving forward when you press the smokestack. It seems like some wires are crossed. Instead of going forward, the wheels move an inch and then it says whatever level it is on. So annoying. Sounds like this is a common problem with this toy based on what others are saying. I love Fisher Price, but we are so disappointed with this toy. It barely lasted 2 months. :( :(\"\\n\"I ordered two.  Both came with the arms and legs separate. Attempting to assemble them by pushing the parts on caused the soft joints to deform. Disabling the two halves of the upper torso in order to install the arms and legs caused the LED bulb, batteries and push button to fall out requiring a few moments of trial and error reassembly. No instructions were included. Some limbs continue to fall out with even light handling. These are not suitable for play by even the most gentle of children.  Clearly what I received was of dramatically lower quality than other reviewers.  I would return them but I assume that would involve shopping them back to China.  Not even worth it. My kids are big Groot fans, and the disappointment was apparent.  They get one star for looking kind of like the character.\"\\nThese props cause my drone to crash a few times.

Don\\'t wear this and just show up at your local firehall expecting to go along and help.

The hat is made of very thin foam and the hook out of what is about equivalent to a garbage bag.\\nDisappointed in quality and working of this.  Hard for kids and myself to get it to go forward.\\n\"Neat toy but, after 2 months, the audio stopped working properly.\"\\nSuper cute but it  doesn\\'t even move!

Not happy with this.\\nThey\\'re nice when they work but I\\'ve had to return 2 out of 3 due to them deflating.\\nI bought 8 of these batteries for my 250 fpv quad.

I hid it for weeks. The bark is just irritating and the way the eyes glow yellow makes me think WTF is wrong with this toy. I\\'m thisclose to throwing it in the garbage! It was barking and \\'walking\\' and then suddenly it seemed to get ticked off and the bark speed increased to an almost consistent bark speed and the eyes glowed. Uh no thanks Demon Dog.

The gaming mechanics have changed tremendously. Its now quite difficult NOT to make millions and millions of dollars and have fine houses and careers. Choosing the standard career path is pretty much pointless; all the best careers are attained by going to college. The straight career path is not even viable any longer. I\\'m not knocking school, but if its that bad, why even make it an option? Every spin they are handing out $50 - $100,00 from the bank for doing things like best waltz or making amazing pancakes. Bank pays you $30,000 for making killer pancakes now? Oh yes, that happens in LIFE. Save your money and hit ebay or your local garage sale - or go raid grandma\\'s closet.\"\\nI purchased this item from another retailer for my 7 year old for Christmas along with several kits. We told our family to also buy kits for her gifts. The toy was broke by the end of the day.  The needles break and bend easily. Once that happens the toy is worthless.

Plastic bent and ball no longer usable. Lasted only one day.\\n\"Terrible quality. The paint is shipped as a concentrate tp shave shipping costs and must be diluted with water. When diluted according to directions and using the provided measuring cup, the yellow and white were way too thin. The white was totally useless and wouldn\\'t cover anything. I cut the water in half (half of the recommended amount) for the yellow and it served as a weak stain. The red and blue worked. Also the brushes were low quality.\"\\n\"Disappointed.

Live in Hawaii and will need equipment like this bag, but this is made from Very poor quality vinyl, and is difficult to operate.\"\\n\"Bowl worked great the first time it was used, but now the pieces won\\'t stay connected. The threads to screw it back together have nothing to stop you when you\\'re tightening it - or to keep it from backing out - and it loosens up when handled, or just plain falls apart. That is if you can get it  to stay together at all to begin with.\"\\nI purchased this as a gift for my niece. The nanny ended up with chemical burns. We had to throw it away as the kid\\'s mom was afraid the the kid was going to get hurt as well.\\n\"I felt like this product was misleading. It should have said &#34;mini bubble machine.&#34; This item comes in a small package and in total the machine is about the size of a soft ball. The bubbles didn\\'t come out that great and only holds about 1oz of bubbles at a time so I have to keep refilling it quite frequently. In total with shipping I ended up paying a little over 18.00 dollars. Just disappointed with size, quality, and what I got for my money. I would not buy this product again.\"\\nDON\\'T BUY!!!the graphics peeled off and backpack tore up!!!!!\\npoor quality something you can buy at the dollar store :(\\n\"The product arrive yesterday, it looks good, but not too good at functionally, it\\'s sounds like something is wrong inside, and sounds horrible when you pull down the bar, also it sounds like CRAP when it stops, definitely not happy with this, if you want to hear how it sounds text me and I\\'ll send you a video\"\\nNot very well made!\\nVERY UPSET! I got 4 packages of these balloons for a huge event we were having for my job and when we went to fill them they lasted for a few and all started to leak and with in 5 min all were deflated. Despite the few bad reviews i read before i bought them there were far more good ones and it saddens me i am here writing a bad review. NEVER again will i buy these. looks like the .99cent store for better ones i have to fill my self.\\nHad a hole in it almost immediately.  Don\\'t buy this!\\n\"Brought this for my son in June for his birthday. I was allowing him to play in house, since it was so small.  A few weeks later my son told me that it was no longer working.  I got busy and forgot to send it back.  This item cost too much money for it not to be working after 2 months.  Will not purchase again.\"\\nThese paints are goopy and gross.  They spill very easily and remain in clumps in the bathwater.  They also don\\'t work very well for &#34;painting&#34; the walls of the bathtub.  They made my daughter\\'s skin itchy and they are difficult to get off of the bathtub when cleaning.\\n\"terrible..after a lengthy shipping period , it arrived totally damaged.<br />I did not try to return or get this issue fixed though, as it was past my needed date of use and only cost a little\"\\nVery disappointed. Work for about 5 pulls and completely died. Couldn\\'t get it to work again.\\nPurchased this for my son\\'s pirate themed birthday party.  It was a flop. The alligator wouldn\\'t actually stand up to be able to toss the rings at it and the rings themselves were junky anyways. The kids just ended up running around with the alligator in hand.\\nBroke after less than 48 hours\\nI was hoping this was painted on and not paper\\nDo not get this unless you have an iPhone. We could not connect with a galaxy or other Samsung phone. My kids were bummed.\\n\"Poor quality.  The antennae wouldn\\'t screw into the controller, I had to glue it.  Cheap foreign plastic.  The battery doesn\\'t fit properly with all the wires into the battery compartment.  I wouldn\\'t recommend.\"\\n\"Very disappointed we purchased this for my sons birthday. After opening today and trying to use it operated for 30 seconds and now dead, will not operate. Battery shows full charge and remote batteries are new.

Seems like the earpiece is broken.\\n\"This is absolute junk. To begin with, when we took the tractor out of the box, we noticed small parts like hubcaps were broken and cracked. We got a little of it put together, and then we realized the SEAT had been left out of the box!! That was not even the worst part. The chain kept coming off the tractor, and it is a real pain to put it back on. To make things even worse, all of the wheels do not spin properly. We ordered a replacement, which was sent quickly at no cost to us, but the chain was even worse on it. I\\'d say this product is VERY overpriced. Cheaply made plastic. Doesn\\'t seem sturdy, durable, or dependable.\"\\nDid not have enuf power to keep its own ass in the air. No control whatsoever.\\nThe fluid from the ball was leaking when it arrived. Had to throw it out.\\n\"Didn\\'t recieve table cover and in reality over priced. Almost 19$ for small plates, cups and napkins.\"\\nI ordered 4 of these for a party 3 of which were ok and 1 was discolored ... they\\'re very cheaply made and stained our vynal fence.\\nrip off\\n\"Pretty poor knock-off of a real Monopoly game.  I understand there are copyright issues, but the description compares it to Monoploy several times, and makes no statements about the differences.  Waste of money.\"\\n\"This is by far not a floor mat, better described as a puzzle. Very disappointed.\"\\n\"I bought this item as I was interested in flying a starter quadcopter and looking at the reviews felt that this could be a good starting deal. I was very disappointed with the product .. In few hours the blades were dysfunctional , the blade protector that came with the package was flimsy and it broke immediately.. i tried to change the replacement blades that came with the product and immediately after that one of the motor broke .. So in 2 days time the quadcopter was a junk and had to throw it in trash.. If you are really interested in flying quadcopters , dont go with this product , or try something else from a reliable store.It is a total waste of my money\"\\nI didn\\'t like it I expected something else this is bad quality\\n\"This is a really confusing game. There are a lot of pieces and the rules are complicated. We bought it for a 9-year-old who loves playing the werewolf game (similar to the Mafia game). We thought this was great because there are usually only three of us around. If you think you\\'ll get a game similar to the group werewolf game that allows a small number of players, you shouldn\\'t buy this pack.\"\\nThey are just terrible! Sad and all crooked.  Looking like dogs after an accident....\\nAll the chalk pieces were broken and not able to be used.\\nI gave this to my dad to put on the back of his car and it broke in 2 days! Horrible!!!!\\nJunk.  Don\\'t buy.  Broken before we opened\\n\"As far as I can tell, this does not have a working voltage regulator; I\\'ve measured voltages as high as 7.5V.\"\\n\"Worst toy ever!!!  Did not inflate. Watched the You Tube video and learned that I had push the inflator further in past the seal.  When I did, the inflator (which is a smooth round piece of plastic, not at all sharp) punctured the other side.  End of toy.<br /><br />As a side note, we did manage to get a little air in it and after 1 min. of play the ball was filthy as the material picks up dirt, grass, pollen etc. like a magnet.<br /><br />Worst toy ever!!!\"\\nI asked my parents for this for my birthday gift.😊but it broke the second day I got it.it got out of control and it started to move by it self.....😱after that I never wanted anything that is rc.(WARNING)DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!thank you......😅😭\\n\"[[ASIN:B001TKFRWG HQ Sport Kite Trick and Competition (Infinity)]]  So this arrived in the mail just 15 minutes ago. As I opened the box, which was terribly packed, I get the kite out and there is sand all over it. It seems like it has been used before. I paid for this kite 182 USD, and the next day, the price went down to 178 USD.  Also, the kite does not include any lines with it.  Such a disappointment and bad investment. I have been researching which stunt kite to buy and ended up selecting this.  Not worth the purchase.\"\\nShould have listened to reviews but was desperate for a gift. Key broke within 5 seconds of use. Drawer opens so fast the money pops out so hard at you. I would pay $5 for this but $20 is way overpriced for this cheap toy.\\nNot what it looks in the picture.

My kid closes the lid as soon as I open it.<br /><br />The switch to change the mode has the &#34;off&#34; mode at the bottom. My kid grabs that handle and inevitable turns the thing off.\"\\n\"I ordered this  for my 5yo. Got a defective product. It has a hole in it and won\\'t stay inflated for longer than an hour. It said that a repair kit was included, but actually wasn\\'t.\"\\nThis was so little. Not worth the price\\nIt\\'s appropriate they call this motor the Fireball because that\\'s what it damn near turned into on the first run in my Slash 2wd after half a pack. Was running a 8.4v 7 cell Traxxas NIMH pack with the XL-5 esc and noticed the truck slowed down so I pulled in thinking low battery and saw the motor was smoking and burning the labels off. I didn\\'t know I was able to yank a motor that fast until this one. Bought this new from somewhere else and it\\'s become a $16 lesson. Do not buy this motor.\\nPoor quality.\\nMaybe 40% of them worked the other 60% were wasted.... I\\'m willing to be there is a much better brand out there.... Huge disappointment for myself and the birthday party....\\n\"Was really disappointed, quick delivery but they snap wrist bands done were discoloured, as if they had been lying in damp storage for years.\"\\n\"I\\'m disgusted that Amazon sells such a terrible product.

I bought 10 and ONLY 1 out of those 10 were actual satin fabric. The other 9 were made of some crappy crunchy-sounding paper-like material. Even if this were only on a front-faced display doll, the paper-like material doesn\\'t even LOOK like satin, so it fails both in the &#34;feel&#34; AND &#34;look&#34; categorie (the satin one I received DOES look nice (in the FRONT ONLY, the back is plain satin, very crappy for a little girl who wants to twirl her doll around and see a beautiful dress from all angles).  It is apparent from previous 5 star reviewers,that THEY got all satin dresses, so they were impressed. Well apparently the company has decided to downgrade quality, and continue to thrive on their old 5-star reviews...that\\'s a slick move, but it won\\'t last long. So, in case you\\'re wondering...today is August 21st, 2015. Do not order past this date or you get crap. I\\'ll post some pictures of these lame dresses soon.<br /><br />I basically paid $20 for 1 decent dress. That dress might be worth $2...but that\\'s the quality I THOUGHT I was paying for. $2 per SATIN dress. And I paid $20 for one. I could buy Barbie quality (+ matching accessories) for $4 each at the store. The quality I recieved here might be worth $0.50 a pop, max...but I don\\'t even WANT that quality. It\\'s not even worth putting on a doll at all...it looks UGLY.\"\\n\"First of all, good readers, lend me your eyes. What color would your brain interpret as the one in the bottle under the title &#34;Hellfire Red&#34;? If you\\'re anything like me, you would expect, you know, red. So much to my surprise as I excitedly opened the box when it came- it was orange. Not so-dark-its-mistakable-for-red- orange, but light orange. The thing is, I\\'m not a super picky person. So I thought, &#34;Eh! Orange is cool, too~&#34; and I thought my problems were solved.<br />But then I actually tried using it.....<br />I have used the regular red Manic Panic and it worked really well on my hair, thus, I wanted to recolor it because I loved it so much. But that was red. Now my hair isn\\'t exactly great hair dying material, I\\'ll admit that. My hair is light brown and so any color trying to go over that is going to have some competition. But the red worked before, so I figured I would give the orange a shot. But no. I followed all the instructions (even using heat in the setting process &#34;for brighter color&#34;) and what did I end up with? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. My hair is the exact same color it was before. The only thing that was dyed was a small part of my scalp where I accidentally got some of the dye on it...<br />Needless to say, I\\'m bummed...<br /><br />The short version (in Haiku form):<br />It\\'s the wrong color,<br />really didn\\'t work at all<br />and I\\'m really sad.\"\\nDescription did not match what is included in box.  I am disappointed in the product but don\\'t have the time to go to the post office to return.\\nComplete knock off! Also it\\'s broken! And has holes in it! It was suppose to be a GUND item and its just a complete disappointment!\\nI bought this because the description claimed it was 11&#34; tall. i needed a tall toy for something. now proportions are all screwed up. better luck next year i guess.<br /><br />WRONG !!! the figurine is only about 5 inches tall\\nthis is NOT a set of 44.  it come with 4 ten frames. 4 --- NOT 44. big difference. I\\'m assuming they meant 44 dot counters\\n\"Did not work on my daughter\\'s ALphie , waste of money\"\\n\"I didn\\'t purchase this on Amazon. My son received it for Christmas and he LOVED it! However, it fell apart 6 months later. I was so disappointed because it\\'s the second Melissa & Doug item that fell apart after a short period of time.\"\\n\"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my nephew and I was very disappointed. They were obviously very cheap and the range wasn\\'t at great as was described. I ended up spending more money getting him something better since I did not have time to exchange it and these were expensive enough, especially for the terrible quality.\"\\n\"Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. I wish I could give this negative stars!  Waiting 1 month for 100 new colors and what I got was 25 colors, 4 pencils each!  Worst quality ever!  Very thin (#3) &#34;lead&#34;; thin, brittle wood that doesn\\'t sharpen well; colors very weak, barely leave color on the paper; colors not even named/labeled!  If I were Amazon I would not even have these for sale!\"\\nThing barely worked when we got it and all it did was make my son angry because it would not work right.\\nMy grandson loves it\\nAir plane came broken\\nDisappointed. This toy appears used.  I get the hassle free wrapping but the packaging was super beat up and the rubber wheel thing is dirty.  I think it\\'s a way to sell used toys to be honest.  I can\\'t return because this is a gift for my son in 2 days.  Hopefully he won\\'t know the difference.\\n\"Yes this is a stunning stuffed T-Rex, but my 3 year old daughter broke one of the legs in no time. Now the doll does not stand up. Its also pretty hard, so its not something to snuggle with. My three year old is not rough with her toys, and this broke.  I have a hard time seeing what the point of this doll is beyond decoration. For the price it shouldnt be so fragile. Maybe mine was defective. I\\'ll be seeking a refund or exchange and will update.\"\\nIt broke within 5 min of my son playing with it.\\n\"Umm,  A Saturn V rocket on a 40\\' foot flatbed trailer?  I think that sends a very wrong message of the size of this rocket and ruins any \\'educational\\' value of the toy.  The Saturn V stood 363 feet tall and over 33 feet in diameter.  Now, if they had included the Saturn V transporter it would have been nice.\"\\n\"Waste of money. Bought two packs, less than half stayed filled with water.\"\\nWould have been a great little truck if it had arrived in one piece.\\n\"I\\'m not sure how this product got high reviews from prior customers.  About half of the sticks I received either did not work at all (almost all the blues) or worked really weakly, unevenly and faintly (the yellows and pinks).  The green ones were somewhat ok but even there, they were uneven.  After bending a couple of times one of the sticks broke and leaked all over me too.<br /><br />This is a poor quality product, probably a case of you get what you pay for, but want to make sure folks no what they are getting.\"\\nFAKE SHOPKINS. My daughter opened them and knew right away. She acted excited but later I had seen she looked like she was crying. I asked her and she said she didn\\'t want to disappoint me since I got them as a surprise for her. Kids are fanatics about these and can tell if they are not the right colors and so on. I returned them and told Amazon about them.\\n\"They don\\'t stay snapped together, most if the eyes had fallen off or were stuck to the rear end or underneath anyway. These are terrible.\"\\nThis is a clear plastic poly-carbonate tray that you cut to fit your chassis.  You will not get a perfect sealed fit with this and as such rocks and dirt will get trapped inside. Those rocks and dirt actually bounce around quite a bit inside getting into your motor and esc ...not good.  I also feel that my esc and motor temps went up a bit using this as heat was trapped inside.<br /><br />There is another manufacturer who sells a flexible material that makes a perfect seal and allows your electronics to breath ...i\\'d seek out that other product instead of this one.\\nNice toy for children with autism. However this item was not put together correctly and there\\'s no way to reverse it. When you pull the horse puzzle piece out and replace it the sound is a mouse and the mouse is the horse. This item was installed incorrectly and there is no way to open it up to replace the switch the two items\\nOne star for the product. Five star for the seller. Please be aware this product is made in CHINA. I bought it because it was advertised as made in USA. Would not made the purchase if I had know.

It\\'s already ripped.  The paw patrol picture is a brittal overlay on top of the actual bag, so it appears it would be fairly easy to break.  I assumed that the design was actually on the bag.  Very disappointed\"\\nBroke after one use. Fathers day gift. At least it brough joy that one day. Waste of money!\\n\"I bought this item for my grandson\\'s birthday. The boys were so excited. The swords did not even last 24 hours. They were playing with them when the green one fell apart and a little later on my grandson dropped the blue one and it broke in pieces. The boys were so disappointed, as am I.\"\\n\"Unfortunately, these batteries do not spec. one of the two batteries I received was 70 x 35 x 20mm (L X W X H) 92.6g, and the second was 70 x 35 x 25mm (L X W X H) 113.2g. Neither correct to the advertised specifications 70 x 30 x 20mm (L X W X H) 108g.

Finally got them all back in the box to discover that I only received 62 of the 64 crayons. They were a birthday present, too. :(\"\\n\"We purchased this for our small 6 yo son from Walmart, at a reduced cost compared to amazon for a birthday gift.  This LOOKS like so much fun.  But, within 1 hour of playing, a handle disconnected from the base- the plastic didn\\'t break, the connection did, making steering impossible. Thankfully, we had purchased insurance. We returned the tank, and ordered a new one. The price had gone up by $75!!!! Walmart matched our old price and shipped us out a new tank.  Within 2 hours, a tire came off (we reinstalled)&#34; and a few minutes later, the handle broke. Step 2 is usually very durable and that is the only reason we would pay for such an extravagant toy. Now we have a son who has been excited and disappointed twice and no real replacement. Very poorly made.\"\\n\"POOR QUALITY-- holes didn\\'t line up & the finish is rough to the the touch. My husband, who is actually good at this kind of stuff, took over an hour to put this together. Not worth the money, i\\'m going to return it...\"\\nCannot even see through the lenses...

My 8 year old received it as a gift and was excited to make a case for her iPod touch. This product is terrible and we ended up throwing the whole thing away. We basically had the same problem as every one else on here. There isn\\'t enough silicone to fill the mold and it leaked through the bottom and made a huge mess. Don\\'t waste your time and money.\\n\"Each piece is much too small, a choking hazard.  I gave it away without opening it.\"\\nPiece of junk.  Broke the first hour of playing.  So disappointing.\\nThis Doll did not come as described. I expected what I saw in the pictures and what was written in the description. I was giving it to my goddaughter because it looked like her baby sister but it ended up being tan with brown eyes not white with green eyes. I ordered another one to give them the benefit of the doubt but it ended up being the same wrong doll.\\n\"If I could give it a zero I would. We bought it for my son and he just recently started playing with it. Not only does the hair fall out in clumps and single strands EVERYWHERE, but he\\'s allergic to it too. He has no allergies, so it\\'s not like he\\'s a super sensitive child, but every time he plays with it his eyes almost swell shut. I seriously wish he had played with it sooner so I could get a refund. Won\\'t make this mistake again.\"\\nBurnt out when I first plugged it in.\\nIf this wasn\\'t already a cheap item I would be upset. However for under 5 bucks it is what it is.  It does not work at all.  My son doesn\\'t know better yet so he just plays with it by putting together and taking it apart off and on again.\\n\"The Balloons don\\'t fill up very much. They don\\'t break easily unless they hit the ground or a wall. Also, they have a hard plastic ring that self ties the balloon once it fills with water. If the balloon hits a person on the side where the ring is, it really hurts! I think it could be quite dangerous if the ring hits someone in the head or eye. Like some of the other reviews, my purchase was mailed directly from China. I don\\'t know if there is another product available from the USA.\"\\nReceived broken - would not Buy from this manufacture - cheaply made -checking a product to ensure it works prior would have been nice.\\nOverpriced for what how small it is\\nCute Roy but not durable at all. My 18 month old is very gentle with his toys and this is only the first to every break! On day 3 the sound stopped working all together.

I can\\'t even get the batteries in the product- and judging from the other reviews, if I did manage to make the herculean effort needed to open it, I might even be rewarded with a product that doesn\\'t work.  First of all, you need a screwdriver to unscrew a small screw in the side of the lens, AND THEN there is a &#34;Push tab&#34; (like on a prescription bottle) that you have to depress to get the lens cover to unscrew... I have tried every imaginable item in my house (to aid my apparently incompetent fingers) to get the Push tab to depress.  I can barely type right now for how injured my hands are.  This thing is ridiculous.  My daughter is screaming.  My son is happy- b/c the other M&D flashlight my MIL bought was like a NORMAL flashlight (Blaze Firefly Flashlight) and was easy to install the batteries (you just unscrew the top and place the batteries in).  Good luck. Buy something else.\"\\nThese machines make the best bubbles(compared to three other machines i have tried)  WHEN THEY WORK. We have gone through 6 of these bubble machines. The motor dies quickly.\\n\"This kit is not engineered correctly.  The fore mast and main mast are designed wrong. In order for them to fit correctly, they should be swapped. The masts are the correct height the way it\\'s designed, buy the fitment is wrong. To switch them would have them fit the other parts correctly, but then the fore mast would be taller than the main mast causing the model not to look right.  I\\'m very disappointed in this kit.\"\\ncheap well not order from them again and over priced\\nThe package was bent and crushed\\nVery cheap materials.  Cars are just awful!\\nNot impressed they have to be made of some really gnarly material cause we purchased them about two months ago and they still stink up the entire house not to mention one of them had it\\'s eyes painted wrong.\\nThe squeegee works nicely. The pen is awful. This was a replacement pen for the original and they both are terrible. They stop working and it just becomes frustrating. I don\\'t care for this product.

It won\\'t work.\\nNot much to it!\\n\"Misleading to say the least, Very disappointed! I bought a couple for my daughters french class, she was so excited for them to arrive.

They do not advertise that these balloons are of pearlized color and therefore making them very &#34;girly&#34; in appearance. All I wanted was flat color primary balloons... Definitely returning bc they will ruin the look of the party & maybe I would consider keeping them if I was throwing a party for a girl. That\\'s something that should be mentioned in the product description. I can\\'t comment on the quality bc I haven\\'t used them & don\\'t plan on it.\\nThe toy is completely broken and bent up.\\nAfter two charges it stopped charging.\\nTried folding all of the planes but could get this to stay in the air for 5 seconds\\nDidn\\'t last one summer\\n\"As a father of two young children, I assembled many furniture orders and this has to be one of the worst assembly experiences I\\'ve had in a while. The instructions are unclear, and to assemble correctly you have to perfectly align ALL of the MDF panels just so then screw it down. The shelves on this unit are some of the flimsiest ones next to the dowel - and - screw holes, and will easily break with minimal pressure.\"\\nYou can get a lower prices one that actually LOOKS good.\\n\"Did not work with my daughter\\'s Alphie, was waste of money to buy it\"\\n\"hamper.is.cute.yet.not.sturdy.enough,handle.broke.on.1st.use\"\\n\"These are fakes, they don\\'t even properly screw on, felt like they were cross threaded. They said DJI on them though were not the same weight, shape, or threaded like real DJI blades. I feel these would be dangerous to use.\"\\nThese were dim and about 20% of them leaked.  NOT recommended\\n\"I have now been through  two of these motors in the last 15 flying minutes with a stock Flyzone Switch RC airplane.  The original motor and the two replacements that I have purchased have all failed with the plastic rotor magnet retainer breaking.  The result is either a fully seized or partially seized motor during flight.  In the final failure I recognized the situation quickly enough to shut the motor down quickly enough to avoid high current damage to the coils on two of the three phases. Unfortunately all three must be healthy to turn the motor.  I initially believed that the first failure was due to overheating, but after creating additional cowl openings, but after placing the propeller adapter as far forward on the motor shaft as possible to allow better airflow into the motor from behind the spinner, I no longer believe that a design issue exists with the Flyzone Switch airplane.  These motors are just coming apart during reasonable operation.  These motors are not worth the price and the warranty is of marginal value given the fixed shipping and processing costs relative to the purchase price.  Unfortunately the options for using a different motor in my aircraft are limited due to motor mount design.  Time for creativity I guess.  Too bad the motors are of such poor quality.\"\\nIt breaks too easy. We prefer smaller sizes.\\n\"I could not get it to work most of the time.  I would get it put together correctly and get it running and then it would just stop without totally unwinding and popping the balloon.  Very disappointed.  Would love to try another one though, but not going to pay for it.\"\\n\"Ripped first day, very cheep.\"\\nChairs are poorly made. Trying to return them was impossible. After many confusing emails I decided to throw away the chairs and forego the refund. Stay away.\\nSeized up after a couple hours of running time.

First, one of the metal contact plates on the inside of one of the walkie talkies has broken loose (it\\'s held to the backing by tiny, fragile plastic prongs). Also, something is rattling inside the charging base, but there is no way to open it to see what the issue is. As a result, I can\\'t plug the cord into the charging base. They don\\'t seem very durable for kids, even ones that are careful with their toys.\"\\nYou can make the same thing with a piece of scrap 2x4 and a old paint Roller handle.

The instant that i plugged it in I heard a pop and found that it fried my Sidewinder 3 ESC on my Axial Wraith.  After taking the whole rig in to my resident expert at the local hobby shop I was told that he has seen this several times from these cheap zippy batteries.  It has cost me almost 90 bucks to rebuild my rock crawler from the damage this battery caused.  In total i saved 4.50 by buying this over a battery from behind the counter locally.

I thought Mom was getting me a toy which would blow lots of bubbles as fast as possible, but really the sounds of gunshots and a bloodthirsty voice screeching FIRE FIRE makes me feel like Elliott Rodgers. A must for all would-be white male serial killers.\"\\n\"This is an amazingly poorly designed puzzle. The pieces are of different sizes and some are very small and easy to lose. I had thought the pieces would all be the same size. Worst of all, the pieces are NOT INTERLOCKING. This means that they slide around as you try to do the puzzle. Why did they have to have a piece in the shape of each state? Why not just put the whole picture on regular puzzle pieces? You can\\'t tell by the fit if one piece fits with another, as you could with interlocking pieces. And without the interlocking feature, each piece is one color, so you don\\'t get color clues to see which piece fits with another. I contacted them to ask for a refund and they sent me a paper which a DHL deliverer would collect when he came to my house SOMETIME. I missed the DHL carrier twice and finally just left the puzzle on a bench of a busy street for someone to take. It\\'s still there.\"\\n\"These are fake.  While I have read the other reviews and am happy to see that other customers are pleased with the product, I am writing this to inform others that if they were looking to buy the officially licensed/real set of these figures, this is not it.

He will not go back together and seems to be missing a part or something. Cinderella is just fine however.\\n\"I received 3 bundles of cards from Amazon (so, 12 boosters) and after seeing my pulls, it became incredibly obvious that these are weighed packs. I buy a lot of Pokemon cards and have been doing so for many years, the odds of opening 12 boosters and only getting common-rares are... well, not likely, to say the least.<br /><br />In recent Pokemon TCG series, people have discovered that Ultra Rares, EX cards, and full-art holos weigh slightly heavier than &#34;regular&#34; cards. As a result, people buy the booster boxes, keep/open the EX/UR packs that they find via weighing, and sell the rest in small groupings like these.<br /><br />If you\\'re fine with a 0% chance of pulling a good card, this is a fine deal. If you\\'d rather buy the cards like they\\'re meant to be bought, aim for the booster boxes, various sets (like the ones that come with the pins) or buy at a retail store that you trust.\"\\nDo not get it. Just don\\'t.\\nWish I had looked at the previous reviews. Very disappointed.\\ncheap\\nThese do not stick at all.

I do it for the kids and when the kids are happy, so am I. Well my happiness ended with my first balloon.    The balloon would not blow up. I heard lots of air coming out of the balloon so I wrapped by finger really tight around the nozzle. After about two pumps of air went in successfully, the air sound was back. I tried twisting the balloon around the nozzle to further keep the air in my balloon, but no success. All of my squeezing and twisting eventually made a hole in the balloon so I tried a second balloon. About twenty minutes later, and no balloon blown up, I gave up. It is much faster to blow up a balloon with my mouth.    Unfortunately I did not have any success with the balloon pump. However, it does come with an attachment for balls. I have not tried it out on balls but I can tell you it did not successfully pump up our balloons.    I received this balloon pump in exchange for a review.

This was used by a 3rd grader, no heavy textbooks were put in this. Just a composition notebook, a folder, snack ( usually an apple or yogurt ) and a water bottle. Very cheaply made!!!\"\\n\"Not what I was hoping for. Like others said, this toy isn\\'t like the one I grew up with. So far I\\'m only able to get a few feet of launch out of these. Will look for something else more expensive.\"\\ndid not work after a week\\n\"PASS!!! Extremely cheap, screws stripped out, holes don\\'t line up. My husband put it together using his own hardware and the pieces still ended up breaking apart and splitting after only a few play times with my VERY gentle daughters.\"\\n\"Impressive robotic dog, but soon developed mobility problems.<br /><br />Our 9 year old daughter really enjoyed Zoomer.  However, after several hours of use (over a few days and a number of recharges), the left-front leg and shoulder did not work correctly.  The leg would intermittently freeze in an extended position, preventing Zoomer from doing many of his tricks.  Even when the leg retracted and worked pretty normally, the leg and shoulder position was &#34;shorter&#34; (in height), which made Zoomer tip/lean towards the front left.<br /><br />Ratings are always subjective and in this case I have mixed feelings:  Because Zoomer malfunctioned and didn\\'t work correctly, I\\'m giving  Zoomer a 1-star review.  However, I would give Zoomer 5-stars for innovation, user interface, and fun factor -- and I really hope that future Zoomer versions will become more dependable.\"\\nThis batch were duds...only about half inflated.\\n\"This is not an 80s bear.

Ugh.\"\\nWAS NOT right battery...  even though it had same model number... CAREFUL\\nStickers we peeling off and box was crumpled.  Very disappointed.\\n\"ordered these for my 4 yr old grandson.  they came with NO instructions at all.  there was NO refill packs.  and when i filled them with water from the hose, they started to fall off, which was OK, but the rubber bands were not small enough to actually keep the water from just squirting right back out!!!  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!  my grandson was SO disappointed that we weren\\'t even able to use them, or throw them!!!  not one of them was usable.  such a frustration, waste of energy, time AND money.  don\\'t waste your time with this brand.\"\\nbeads spill over side amd takes up way too much room!! this SUCKS\\n\"My package arrived without the 3 Barbies, ski clothes and snow toys.

Very disappointing.\"\\nI bought 8 of these as decor for a military themed party and all 8 came back in the gray color. I didn\\'t mind the variation of color but at least give me a variation.

It is still useable but I\\'m disappointed in the quality of the bag.\\nS***ty preorder and launch. Everything got mixed up with wrong displays wrong pictures. Be wary.\\n\"I had an unfortunate experience with this pen the very first time it was used. Some of the material globbed onto the tip and hardened underneath it. When trying to take the tip off to clean it, the piece that the tip attachment screwed onto actually broke rendering the pen pretty much unusable anymore.

I ordered July 9th.  It never arrived.  Even though something may be affordable, sellers should respect all buyers because some of us might have returned.\"\\nBought for grandsons birthday. He was disappointed because the vehicle was too small.\\n\"Very poor quality. Doesn\\'t worth even a small amount of money. The pieces are tiny, thin, and poorly cut.\"\\n\"Banner was folded oddly and more than it needed to be so now has huge wrinkles that I am not sure I can get out. Extrmely poor quality, feels like something would get at dollar store. Plus end cap on rod missing, but that doesnt matter since I will not hang this up. Picture of item posted here gives impression of being something much better.\"\\n\"I would give this product zero stars, if i could.  I can\\'t even get the batteries in the product- and judging from the other reviews, if I did manage to make the herculean effort needed to open it, I might even be rewarded with a product that doesn\\'t work.  First of all, you need a screwdriver to unscrew a small screw in the side of the lens, AND THEN there is a &#34;Push tab&#34; (like on a prescription bottle) that you have to depress to get the lens cover to unscrew... I have tried every imaginable item in my house (to aid my apparently incompetent fingers) to get the Push tab to depress.  I can barely type right now for how injured my hands are.  This thing is ridiculous.  My daughter is screaming.  My son is happy- b/c the other M&D flashlight my MIL bought was like a NORMAL flashlight (Blaze Firefly Flashlight) and was easy to install the batteries (you just unscrew the top and place the batteries in).  Good luck. Buy something else.\"\\n\"The item was cute however, the batteries inside came corroded so the toy never worked. It took me a while being a new mom to look at the batteries. So I suggest if you buy this item check the batteries.\"\\nDid not like at all since the stencil didn\\'t come apart and without being able to remove the fabric top layer the glue/glitter don\\'t work.\\nThis puffed a few bubbles and just stopped. I was very disappointed because I purchased it for my daughter\\'s birthday party and unfortunately that part was ruined\\n\"I\\'m glad other people have had good results using this product.

They said they would send me a replacement, they never came.\"\\n\"The tail wings are set at the wrong position, causing the plane to gap up, stall and nosedive.  They never made it past 8 feet or so....<br />Bad QA.  I do not recommend this product.\"\\nArises broken. :(\\nSank turns upside down. Not even good as a non powered toy\\n\"I hate this doll.  The hair is really such a mess.  You can\\'t really comb it.  My four year old daughter tried and literally within minutes of getting it out of the box, the whole thing was a tangled mess.  The quality of the hair was very thin and is really not the kind meant to be combed!  As a little girl, I owned a Barbie doll with longer hair that come with a brush and hair accessories.  It was a hand me down from my older sister and I was still able to play with the hair, make braids, etc.  I thought this would be similar, but it absolutely was not.  We own other Disney Princess dolls that my daughter loves to play with that have more or less remained in good condition.  I wish the people who made this doll actually tested it out!  Nice concept but does not work!\"\\n\"I sent this as a birthday gift to my grandson, and it did work at all.  Wouldn\\'t even turn on.

My kids (2 and 5) love painting, but this is the worst paint ever (purchased on a whim without looking at reviews). It is so thin and runny that is literally flies everywhere. I had to give my kids a bath immediately after using this paint (it spread everywhere) and their skin is still stained. I dread finding out what the laundry is going to look like...Off to scrub my ENTIRE kitchen and start a load of wash. Paint it going in the trash!\"\\n\"too loud and cheap plastic thing, get the wood one instead\"\\nI just received these today.  I was expecting to receive the 3 different zombies in the photo.  I wanted to display them at my grand daughters party.  Instead I received 3 of the purple guy.  Nowhere does it say that it might be 3 of one zombie.  This is very disappointing.  The party is in 2 weeks.  I don\\'t have time to return them and order from somewhere else.  I think this is false advertising.\\nI loved this right out of the package. I gave it to my daughter and within the first 30 minutes a leg and arm fell off. They were easy to get back on the first couple of times but the arm no longer fits two days later. I\\'m really disappointment that this broke so fast. I do not recommend purchasing this toy.\\nDon\\'t waste your money!\\nbroke on 2nd use\\nI ordered this during the lightening deal.  Upon receiving the item I opened it and noticed all the pieces look used and many of them even have scratches that look like teeth marks.

We ordered this go-kart seat for a used go-kart we just bought, this seat was represented as an actual adult size seat, but to our dismay the seat was plastic and made for a model or small toy. And the details of black were stickers to place on the seat to make it look real. This was false representation, and we were very displeased with Amazon for letting this happen. All of the other parts, tires, and brakes were the real thing.\"\\n\"Bottom piece of chair broke the first day when my niece sat down, not even 20 minutes after taking time to put it together. I don\\'t know if it was her weight or just cheap material. I was able to order a replacement part (not a whole chair replacement) but that didn\\'t work either. Bummer I wasted almost 50 bucks.\"\\nHorrible! Doesn\\'t not glow\\nIt was junk. Couldn\\'t even get it put together. Do not recommend it for anyone.\\nIncredibly cheap toy.

These weren\\'t important qualities for a toy semi?\\nThis looks like it has been opened and used already. The tape that was used to put it back together has come apart and the box is kind of smashed.

I ordered 4 different ones expecting them to be the same quality of one I had seen that a co-worker had.  He said he got his about 20 years ago from a friend.  HIS animal magnet was made of a very sturdy, thick velour like material.  HIS had very big magnets in the feet so that you could actually stand it up and position the animal in different standing positions.  THESE animals are made of a very cheap almost furry shammy like material.  WAY too flimsy to have the legs actually support the creature in any meaningful positions.  The magnets are very small in the feet and there is one in the chest.  You would think this would be a good thing but the legs are so flimsy that the magnets keep pulling the legs into the chest.  CHEAP CHEAP and way too expensive for that!!!  For the price I was expecting the quality of the one my co-worker showed me.  If I had paid .99 cents for these I would have kept them, but at $5.00 or $6.00 each???  NOPE.  They look much higher quality in the pictures than they actually are.\"\\ngreat idea but the roll we got was kinda dented so i would not describe it as a roll however it was a clever gift if it doesnt show up damaged\\nThese things peeled off within 2 hours!\\nA waste of money.

While the incredibly hard to read assembly instructions resembled a faxed copy of a fax, and were for an entirely different model, the electrical system needed very little assembly other than adding a fuse and charging the battery. That being said, the quad I purchased for my son\\'s birthday simply never worked.  I attempted to contact the manufacturer numerous times, and was directed through what seemed to be a scheme to deceive and misdirect.

I was excited about the idea of my child learning about the world, different continents through such a creative way, using the controller (stick), watching pilot flying across the globe,but the noises that the toy made turned out to frighten him, so he didn\\'t really care about any other features of the toy.\"\\nI it arrived today and was torn\\nthe quality of the cup didn\\'t  match my expectation\\nBox came with dinged corners and no amazon exclusive sticker for my amazon exclusive pop! Glad all my past amazon exclusives came as advertised and without damaged packaging\\n\"as some other reviewers mentioned, the wheels will not turn no matter what surface it is on.  I can barely turn them with my hands.  luckily, my grandson received two more of these for his first birthday.  the other two came from walmart and worked perfectly.\"\\n\"Piece of junk. I thought it would be a fun novelty, and it would be, if it worked.\"\\nBroke the neck! It is useless.\\nfeathers everywhere! Very low quality.\\n\"We received this product as a gift.  The sealed package contained the contents of a Doc McStuffins Memory Match game - not Frozen.  My 2-year-old daughter was sorely disappointed.  Buyer beware - you may, or may not receive the correct contents of the game.  Looks like the people in the warehouse should play \\'match\\' games more.\"\\n\"This is the worst quality toy I have ever seen. You can tell it is probably made of the most toxic plastic...Really not great. The tools are not as bad as the belt, though. The belt is almost sharp the plastic is so stiff and thin...<br /><br />And the shape of the hat isn\\'t really appropriate for a human head. Maybe baby\\'s head is just too round, though. =\\\\\"\\ndid not arrive with amazon exclusive sticker as photos shown when it was bought\\nThis is the cheaper quality of the devices used to charge multiple phantom batteries.  Don\\'t get this one!  It is not regulated like the others.\\nsend back for a refund\\n\"This really is a POS, but for $0.99, what do you expect?  I got it for the converter cables.  At least they seem to work.  The charging hub, on the other hand, is as flaky and poorly connected/wired as other reviews have discussed.\"\\nNot up to the mark. Very low quality product\\n\"I was disappointed with this product.  It is not deep enough.  When I put the tiles in the plastic bag, it was too big for the bag.  I was not able to close the zipper.  I had to find two smaller bags for the tiles.\"\\n\"Worked pretty well for about a year, then became really slow and things were hard to find (menus, etc.).  Reformat did not help.  The kids no longer play with it any more.\"\\ntoy broken\\nThis product for some reason didn\\'t work as well as it shows in the pictures. The pigment didn\\'t show clearly on the hair and we tried two different hair sprays on this product.\\njunk. I know it\\'s just a cute prop gun for a Halloween costume but it fell apart the first time my kid pulled the trigger. i had to glue it back together.\\nNot what I expected. But my 1 yr old loves it so that\\'s all matter\\nThis was a five pack and I only got 1 container\\nAll crayons were broken when they arrived\\n\"I want to give it 5 stars but got 4 bad ones in a row. First one the figure was fine but the accessory had a deformed peg. Second one, the jaw of 1 head biological head kept falling off. Third one, jaws of 2 biological heads kept falling off. Fourth one, jaws and necks of biological heads kept falling off. Tried attaching them back together but for they won\\'t stay on if you want to move it which is very frustrating especially for the price of the figure. This figure lacks quality control. A very disappointing entry to this wonderful series. The sculpt is great and the figure has lots of articulation, nice accessories. If the joints held together better like the initial releases, this would have been a fantastic release. I own almost every SHMA figure, standard Bandai, X-Plus, and NECA figure. I am hoping Tamashii and Bluefin will consider improving the QC on their next release (in hopes there are an actual new figure instead of a repainted reissue). I will give Mecha-King Ghidorah another shot, in hopes I will get one that doesn\\'t fall apart... If you are a casual collector, I\\'d recommend skipping this release.\"\\n\"The cables on the steering wheel snapped the first day. They did replace it for us, but now the car speaks in Chinese. You can\\'t really see the lights outside, unless you drive it in the dark. The battery doesn\\'t last even 30 min. One of the red threads on the tires is loose, now and my son has used the car not more than 20 times. I would not recommend it for you child. Also it is supposed to be for kids up to 7 years, but my son\\'s legs are way over the wheel and he just turn 4. I think he will not fit in it in 6 months. Looks really nice on the picture, but not that nice when you get. And will not fit a second child at all\"\\ngot the wrong packs inside the tin<br />was supposed to be black and white packs<br />but got xy packs<br />thought its was ok but then i open them and<br />got terrible cards so thinking someone repackage<br />this tin\\nI am very disappointed with this product. I purchased multiple kits and each package is either missing a vital component or contains pieces that are the wrong size (too small/large). A real waste of money - I won\\'t purchase again!\\n\"Disappointed with this figure! The waist is WAY bigger than the stomach/back area, so it doesn\\'t look good. Plus there is a big space between the waist & the stomach/back. Shocked that this quality passed to put in pack & sell.\"\\nFake don\\'t buy\\nPopped the first time we played with it\\n\"Very disappointed, ordered a 2nd 12-pack, 3 weeks apart, and received the exact same shopkins. Very upset child... and because she didn\\'t realize that they were ALL the same until after she opened it, we cannot return them.\"\\nThe picture shows 2 necklaces but the order only includes 1. Very misleading. I was expecting to get 2 and when I received the 1 in the mail I realized that you also do not get a choice of which of these you want. If i had known it was only one i woild not have bought it.  I also would have prefered the blue Elsa one but recieved the pink one.\\n\"I wish i could rate zero stars, this is a display piece i hoped to present in its packaged condition, however i noticed the actual hairpiece was missing so i opened the box, sure enough the ponytail part is missing and was not included. Such an inconvenience to pay full price for an incomplete product.\"\\n\"This is essentially a few sheets of shiny paper and some sticker sheets. The box falls apart easily, which makes it hard to store the stickers in the box and because the sheets are separate they eventually just get lost. After my daughter played with this a few times I had to throw it away.\"\\nI only got one flight out of my plane. There was no apparent damage in that flight but upon charging the plane for the second time it would no longer turn on. I might have returned it for another one but I was pretty disappointed in the flight characteristics of the plane during that maiden flight. Seemed under powered and prone fly in a similar pattern. Additional flights may have changed my mind but I\\'ll never know. Amazon return was a breeze.\\nI rode this thing into a river and it stopped working. Its junk\\n\"i got broke in less than 3 minutes, and the child dint even touch it...\"\\nCheap\\n\"not really loaded dice, it is a magic trick with the box and dice.  Going to keep the dice, only because I wanted a pair of the smaller ones with the red dot as the one spot.\"\\nExtremely over priced.\\nI thought I ordered the Ivory one too...but when it arrived it was bright red. I would have preferred to get the Ivory. any way to switch? I still have the original packaging etc...\\n\"This item was too small.  It was even smaller than my 3 year old nieces crown for her birthday party.  Since this was for a 50 year old, didn\\'t think the size would be doll like size.  Very dissapointed as was not able use for my sister\\'s birthday.\"\\nThis hat didn\\'t look like the picture. It isn\\'t really possible to wear as well. It pretty much just sits on the top of your head. Luckily it wasn\\'t very expensive. Very disappointed. Hopefully the pictures I put up will help people save their money.\\nWe ordered this as a gift for a birthday party.  We intended to be giving a larger sized plush since it lists the size in the description.  It clearly says it is 12&#34; from the front to the back paw.  It is actually 7\\'.  Measuring this from the nose to the tip of the tail still would still not get you to 12&#34;.  It is cute but very poorly described.  We would never have purchased this if it had been correctly described.\\nLove the float chair for the day or so that it last\\'s....but I\\'ve bought 2 of them now & the seat tore within a few days...and I am not a big person or do I let kid\\'s rough house with it...if they had a better way of attaching the seat it would be GREAT!!\\nThe safety belt popped out of the back when my one year old granddaughter was swinging and she almost fell out. I was so frightened. The belt is a very unsafe design! This seat needs to be recalled and the belt needs to be replaced with a safer version.\\nTotal junk.  Sending back.  I should have known the minute I saw the crushed paper thin cardboard box it was in.  Dollar store stuff. Very disappointed.\\nYes just purchased a set of the rc rims they say for rc anyway and went to get tires for them and my local hobby shop said there is no way to glue them on because there is not a lip big enough to do so.so I went to another hobby shop for a second opinion and got the same results now I payed $80 for the set and I can\\'t return then I\\'m sure because I painted them to match my truck so this is just a heads up to other potential buyers don\\'t buy them they don\\'t work\\nDOES NOT LOOK LIKE WHAT\\'S SHOWN IN THE PICTURE\\n\"Purchased Bubble machine and wands did not rotate, Returned and received a new one and same thing is wrong with it. The fan works but the wands do not rotate.

The material is very cheap; it feels like it is made from recycled toilet paper tubes.  The edges are cut very poorly.  Pieces have to be forced together and many have frayed edges.  I thought it would be fun to finish but it is already back in the box.\"\\nDON\\'T BUY.\\nThey must have ran out and sent me a bottle of water. Hardly no smell at all. Waste of $$$\\nSmells absolutely toxic. Not worth the hassle of the return but whatever chemical they put on these ropes should be prohibited.

Instead of wood, the blocks are made of cheap, light plastic. Instead of stacking the pieces on a flat surface, you have to use the platform and cough up 3 AA batteries for it to work. To play, you stack the blocks like you would with Jenga, play like regular Jenga, but the platform will randomly vibrate and this causes the blocks to slightly shift position. It\\'s more annoying than anything because the rules state that 5 seconds after your move you are responsible for the tower. So you could do a perfect move, the vibration could then start and knock the tower down and you would be responsible.  Eh. Just buy regular Jenga, which is a tried and true simple game and you\\'ll be happier for it.\"\\nIt broke as soon as we started filling it up with helium very disappointed for the price you pay it was a very special day for my son very disappointed\\nThese are not worth the money.  Who ever wrote the good reviews must of got different juggle bubbles then me.  They pop instantly the second you touch them and also pop while you are trying to blow them.  These are just regular bubbles.  These are frustrating and disappointing.\\n\"I THOUGHT THIS UNIFORM CAME WITH THE SWORD PICTURED, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT ARRIVE.  I\\'M NOT SURE WHY THIS ONE WOULD COST MORE IF THERE IS NO SWORD.\"\\nBroke after only a few shots. Mechanism is complicated seems to be fragile and flimsy. Not solid at all.  Needed to return it to Amazon almost immediately as the mechanism jammed and couldn\\'t remove the magazine.\\n\"There is nothing special about this tiny lego piece so I cannot figure out why the big price!!! Very unhappy with this purchase and I would return it if my 10 year old grandson was not so happy with this &#34;toy&#34;, which I think should be classified as a collector item and NOT sold as a toy.\"\\nMy son uses it. Nice item to feel cool.\\nWAAAAAAY too much time to pump air into it & take air out of it.\\nMy 10 year old daughter actually saved up her money and purchased it. It worked for about one day then the needles broke and it stopped working. She wasn\\'t using it incorrectly or using it too rough. There doesn\\'t seem to be any replacement parts. My daughter is very broken up because the needles broke and there is no clear way to fix it.\\n\"horrible quailty, very cheaply made, and had to return it.

The picture shows light green/purple/pastel-colored butterflies, and clear packaging. I got dark colored butterflies and bright red packaging. I also tried flying them but with very little success, most just nose-dived. Very disappointed but I guess that\\'s why they are fairly cheaply priced.\"\\nBroke on the first day.  The straps\\n\"The car broke after two uses and although we were able to get a replacement, it broke again.  After one replacement I was not able to return the second one.  For the price of the car I thought it would be more durable.\"\\nConfetti is right small as heck. Not worth $\\nThis table looked so cute but it arrived damaged two times so I\\'m not going to reorder anymore.\\n\"Pointless, no seat back to help them push the pedals. Poor design. My 2yr old barley can use it.\"\\n\"The truth is, they were a complete waste of money and absolutely did not meet our expectations. My kids planned a birthday party and we were having 19 kids over at our house. We filled the balloons up about 2 hours before the party. At the time we filled them up, only one or two per bunch did not fill. By the time the party started, we only had about 22 balloons out of all of them. The rest leaked and were no good. The other thing to note is that the balloons when filled are small compared to normal water balloons. You need to tell people these are for immediate use. I would never buy these again!<br /><br />Disappointing to say the least not to have the water balloon activities at their party.\"\\nSuper cheap the clasp broke in 3 days after I received it. Disappointed because it was super cute.\\ndid not realize the size was too small\\nStitching could have been tighter and it doesn\\'t work... It doesn\\'t talk or have a place for you to get to the box to figure out what\\'s wrong.\\nreally cheap quality.  all three of the hats I ordered arrived crushed and the felt was so thin there really was no way to fix them and make them look good.<br />The return and refund process was smooth.\\n\"Very disappointed in the wood frame. There was no slot to put it in. They gave tacks to just lay it on the back and fasten. Rough texture, will have to sand myself before staining. Will never purchase again!\"\\n\"Very disappointed in this item. It came with a cracked base, and the middle battery keeps popping out, even with the battery compartment screwed shut.  After 2 nights of use the only light that is working is the red one.  I read that colors can be selected. This is NOT the case. There is only an on and off switch. It also does not rotate.  My daughter is in love with her &#34;special light&#34; and I don\\'t want to have to buy another one.\"\\n\"This is the second one we have ordered, it was a replacement for the first one (a birthday present) which broke after about a week. This one was not working from the start, but the girl had been so excited to finally get a new one that it wasn\\'t returned. Also ordered a purple one but the one that arrived was yellow. Extremely dissatisfied.\"\\nThe trigger stuck on this thing the first time we used it\\nNo\\n\"OMG!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It was cheap, kept breaking, stiffy, and had a horrible paint job!!\"\\n\"This set includes 40 blocks with the following dimensions: Eight large red blocks (12&#34; x 6&#34; x 3&#34;), eight medium blue blocks (6&#34; x 6&#34; x 3&#34;), and 24 small yellow blocks (6&#34; x 3&#34; x 3&#34;). In other words, the large blocks are twice the size of the mediums, which are twice the size of the smalls. Taken together, you\\'re buying the equivalent of 18 large blocks for $36 (including shipping). That\\'s $2 per large block---although most of them are actually smaller blocks that are a pain to build with.<br /><br />OK, now check out Mondo Bloxx, also on Amazon (see link below). You get FORTY blocks the exact same size as the large Melissa and Doug blocks for---are you ready---$42. That\\'s $1.05 per block, barely half the price of the M&D blocks. Plus they\\'re all large, so much better for building, and actually sturdier. (I know because I stupidly bought the M&D blocks first, without doing any comparison shopping.)<br /><br />Melissa and Doug make great products. But in this case they\\'re totally ripping you off. Get Bloxx instead:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COVGRZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\"\\nI would give this zero stars if I could.  My 4 year old got this for her birthday and it doesn\\'t work.  I put brand new batteries in and it doesn\\'t do anything.  I bought a replacement today and it also doesn\\'t do anything.  No wonder they are clearanced out at Walmart!  Don\\'t buy this.\\n\"Really tiny chess set, poorly made\"\\n\"The jaw harp sent was not as pictured. I\\'ve owned many jaw harps over the years, and the design pictured has always given the best sound. The jaw harp sent to me was not this design, but rather a much cheaper one that is hardly audible when played. If you are looking for a usable jaw harp, this is not the right one. If you are looking for a toy for your young kid, by all means order this one, because there won\\'t be a sound coming out of it.\"\\nnot what I\\'m expect\\n\"This is 80% cheap plastic, I thought it was diecast.  Tried to return item but the seller was going to charge me $6.00 to return item.\"\\ni want to return these products i brought the wrong case for the innotab 3S\\nItem came as expected; that\\'s where my pleasure with this product ended. Went to a Party store to have it inflated and they informed me after inflating the rest of Elmo that there was no bladder insert for the head. The parts that were able to be inflated stayed inflated for less than 2 hours. The product did not come with the weights for the feet and the overall quality was disappointing. This was ordered for a 2yo b-day party so there was no time to replace or get a refund. It went immediately to the trash.<br /><br />*Also inflating a balloon this size at a store costs more than the product!!! Beware!!!\\n\"Disappointed, No matter how much you wind it, it only goes a couple of inches.  :-(\"\\nPlease dont waste money in buying this product as it does not fit Hubsan Nano Q4 H111 .. it is a waste of money\\nThis is the second one if there\\'s I have got and they are junk they work for a few days then the wheels stop moving\\n&#34;Set&#34; of 28 is VERY misleading.

Completely inappropriate for a child\\'s toy.  There is no option to turn the song off.\\n\"Not what I expected, stickers not on the cubes\"\\n\"Lasted about 15 minutes before a motor burned out.  Let the motor cool, plugged battery back in resulting in a transformer meltdown that stunk up the house.  Avoid this product.\"\\n\"I wanted to love this little guy, but sadly once we opened the package it was clear I hated it. It is so cheaply made that my kids will destroy this vacuum in one, maybe two days of normal play. It had a dead battery upon opening and is small. Do not waste your money on this...I wish I would have.\"\\n\"These hats should not be advertised as also working for the &#34;average adult.&#34; These are definitely for small children (unless our bachelorette group of girls just have abnormally large-sized heads?). The hats came on time, as expected, but some of them had small spots on them that looked like either oil or water stains, and they all had lots of excess thread hanging off of them. I would not order these again.\"\\n\"When we first got this product my kids really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, the base started leaking air immediately after the first inflation.  I was unable to locate the source of the problem, but we were able to use it if I re-inflated it before each use.  The set also came with three swords and three shields.  One shield and one sword had leaks upon receipt and we were never able to use them.  I contacted Swimline to ask for a replacement base and they never got back to me.  I don\\'t expect these products to last more than one season, but this didn\\'t even make it through the first day.  This is my last Swimline product.\"\\n\"VERY GLASSY FOR MY SON TO PLAY AND HE IS 7 YEARS OLD,\"\\nPiece of junk!  The battery will not even charge so we haven\\'t been able to get it to work. I bought this for my sons birthday and now I am 3 days past the return window so I just threw my money away this item. Very disappointed.\\nJust received this baby in the mail. Her face is adorable but her hair would have been better left off. It looks terrible. Definitely not worth the $130+ $15 shipping through post office.\\nZipper broke upon arrival! I will be returning this for a full refund\\n\"Very small!  Not good for beach play, fell apart very easily.  Very cute looking.\"\\n\"The following is bad news for scalpers who are selling this set for 3-4 times its original price and good news for everyone else out there. Lego had decided to re-release this set as 10249 Winter Toy Shop for $80. It will be available for Lego VIPs on September 16, 2015 and October for the rest of the public. This re-release will also set a precedent for the rest of the retired Lego sets that are being scalped out there. What it means is that Lego is willing and will re-release retired sets if there is a strong demand. Thank you Lego for demonstrating the spirit of Christmas with this re-release. Lego sets are meant to be played with and being enjoyed instead of being scalped and hoarded.\"\\nWay to small to use for anything and NOT easy for a child to use and priced way to high for what you get. I gave to good will....\\n\"Horrible box was all taped up, with more than half the parts missing\"\\nIts really fun for a week and then it starts to loose its magnetic field... Not worth it\\nI paid $30 for this ball that lasted three hours in my house I told the kids it won\\'t pop so they stab it with a pin smh\\n\"These things lasted like, 2 weeks. The kids forget them in the pool, they get sucked into the strainer, clog the flow and get ripped to shreds. They aren\\'t even fun to play with, there are just balls that hold water and splash a bit when they hit something. When we\\'re in the pool, the only thing to hit is each other\\'s faces...which is an issue.\"\\nVery poor quality. Toy was not working at all.\\n\"Bought this as a gift for my 6 y/o birthday. It came broken. The tail is supposed to &#34;click&#34; in the back and when you push the button it pops out. This one didn\\'t. So, we sent it back to Amazon and promptly received another. Same story, the tail does not &#34;click&#34; into the back so now we have a tail less dragon. My six y/o asked not to send it back again. So, don\\'t waste your money unless you are OK with getting a broken product.\"\\nVery unhappy.. Half were broke or had holes. Children were very disappointed.\\nDisappointed as I was expecting larger Lego pieces. Thought the junior  size for age 4 might be smaller than duplo but larger than regular Legos. Small pieces were difficult for a four year old even with  supervision .\\nLike something you\\'d win at a carnival...not good quality.\\n\"Batteries die very quickly, unless it is shut off. Poor steering.\"\\n\"No instructions! Useless piece of crap, wrong color too. I wish i read the review before ordering. If there was instructions i will not even complain because at least i can try to make it look like one. The shipment took 59yrs!! Lol what a big joke. I will take a picture later and add on this comment\"\\nThis is the CANADIAN version of the game.  A huge portion of the questions in all categories have to deal with Canada.  I\\'m not trying to downgrade Canada but not being from there its hard to know these very region specific questions and the game seems unfair.  More than anything about half of the questions we encountered in 2 categories (they renamed them from Classic Trivia Pursuit but I think they are called Arts and then Entertainment now) had to deal with Canada.  &#34;What CBC radio host did THIS in the 1970s?&#34;  Who knows?<br /><br />For Americans or quite frankly any non Canadian this is NOT the version for you.\\nIt is horrible! Hard to put it together cause it is made so cheap!\\n\"This item was missing the globe top, and is much smaller than depicted. Overpriced And a poor value.\"\\nGot this for my girls to play with. Maybe I didn\\'t read it right but this toy is extremely small!!! Even for the price it is tiny. Will probably... nope will end up having to buy a bigger BETTER one very soon.\\n\"Very disappointed in these.  I ordered 4 different ones expecting them to be the same quality of one I had seen that a co-worker had.  He said he got his about 20 years ago from a friend.  HIS animal magnet was made of a very sturdy, thick velour like material.  HIS had very big magnets in the feet so that you could actually stand it up and position the animal in different standing positions.  THESE animals are made of a very cheap almost furry shammy like material.  WAY too flimsy to have the legs actually support the creature in any meaningful positions.  The magnets are very small in the feet and there is one in the chest.  You would think this would be a good thing but the legs are so flimsy that the magnets keep pulling the legs into the chest.  CHEAP CHEAP and way too expensive for that!!!  For the price I was expecting the quality of the one my co-worker showed me.  If I had paid .99 cents for these I would have kept them, but at $5.00 or $6.00 each???  NOPE.  They look much higher quality in the pictures than they actually are.\"\\nToo lightweight\\n\"Terrible quality.  They constantly have feedback.  The range is about 20 feet.  When you talk, it\\'s hard to hear the person on the other end because of all the static.  These are crap.\"\\n\"I followed the instruction very carefully, but can\\'t connect with my iPhone (even after I updated the latest IOS.<br />Help!!!!\"\\nI received these bags today and they are so camouflaged that 5 out of the 12 bags you couldn\\'t even see the drawstrings.  They were defective and had no drawstring at all.  They were all the same color green and made of nylon.  None of them were made of cotton like the description said.  They had a lot of loose thread on every bag.  It seemed pretty poorly constructed.  I am sending it back.  There are several vendors for this product and I received my from ToyVendor.\\n\"Wish I could give this better reviews but where is the detail in the mold?<br />I will have to take a picture of ice later so you can see what I mean.<br />I was so disappointed, was looking forward to this mold, but it doesn\\'t have the detail to make it a great addition for a Star Trek fan.\"\\nFor $80 definitely the worst buy ever.<br />it\\'s way to small and height wise aswell ....<br />the case over the ring is all plastic ... you would think atleast for $80 it\\'s be glass.<br />worst buy and if it wasn\\'t a gift for someone I\\'d return it right away.\\n\"What I received was a bootleg, and I\\'m disappointed. No Toei sticker, and the figure was discolored.\"\\nAll it takes to leak is small drop. My son dropped the water gun to the ground then started to leaks.

It came today completely covered in this black stuff. It was slimey and I tried to wipe off the black and it wouldn\\'t come off.

We filled them up right before we left and drive for 15 mins and half were empty..... No where on the package does it say &#34;must use within 10 mins&#34; it was the shortest water balloon fight ever\\n\"This is pure crap. The 50\\'s called and they want their plastic fighting cowboys and Indians back, not to mention the Little Black Sambo coloring pages.  I would sooner give the Bag of Glass that Dan Akroyd hustled on a classic SNL skit than many of the items found in this pack. Do what I ended up doing, go to Dollar World and buy the packs of glow in the dark spiders and snakes, and assorted other items, granted not high quality stuff, but miles above the quality level in this pack and a way better value.\"\\nI did not receive the bonuses promised to make a complete set\\nTerrible. Came warped.  Could not put this together.  Very disappointed. Would not recommend.\\nLove Jack Vale and his videos but this product after 2 days already has a gash in the side of it.

The product was to be in frustration free packaging but the toy was to be in new condition.  That is not what I got.  The toy arrived with dried food and milk on it.\\nOverpriced.\\nI was expecting them to get bigger with the description. They don\\'t get that big before they start falling apart. My son still enjoyed watching the egg crack and the Dino come out but after that the limbs breaking off freaked him out.\\nNot a good product. Fisher price drawing board is much better.\\n\"This is one of the most annoying toys I have encountered thus far in my son\\'s 10-month old life. The voice is completely obnoxious, and there are two sound settings- LOUD and LOUDER. It plays several tunes all at once, and is very busy and distracting. I don\\'t know how any baby learns anything from this; there\\'s just too much going on. Once you stop playing with it, it drones on forever unless you actually shut off the switch. Additionally, some of the things it says don\\'t even make any sense- I think it says something like &#34;the flowers spin in the sun&#34;. What? There aren\\'t even any flowers on the whole toy, not that it would make sense if there were anyway. I can\\'t speak to its use in learning to walk yet, but it is much less sturdy than I had anticipated so I\\'m not sure it\\'s going to work for that purpose.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it\\'s one of my son\\'s favorite toys. Many times I\\'ve considered getting rid of it, but it keeps him occupied so I endure the clamor. Hopefully he\\'ll lose interest soon, because I\\'d like to retire it to the basement. I wouldn\\'t even give it away, that\\'s how much I can\\'t stand it- I wouldn\\'t do that to anyone else.\"\\nItem received was not new in package (see photo) or in good condition (does not work).\\n\"Don\\'t waist your money! As a stationary modle its looks nice, good detailing on the paint and decals but thats where the positivity stops. Literally within 90 seconds of turning it on and driving it this thing was broken. The drive motors are not secured to the gearbox, its a joke! The moment too much stress is placed on the drive moter gearbox assembly the drive motors leverage themselves up and away from the gearbox and GAME OVER! If you are ok with taking it apart and pushing the motor assembly back down every 30 seconds of driving then buy this toy, if not then stay away. Did I mention there is a high and low speed mode? Well there is and the low speed mode is the one that allows 30 seconds of driving until the motors leverage themselves up and away, the highspeed mode... Ha forget about it! In highspeed mode if you look crossways at the accelerator the motors are up up and away without ever having moved the tank at all.\"\\n\"Bought this for my one-year-old niece\\'s birthday party and it was way too small.  She is a typically sized girl, so I don\\'t know if this hat is just supposed to fit newborns or what.  It\\'s billed as \\'toddler-sized\\', so I thought that meant she could wear it up to age 3.  I was too small to even balance on her head for pictures.\"\\nThey did not stay put together and kept popping apart\\nBox came damaged.\\nI wouldn\\'t waste my money on this...\\ncame broken\\nDoes not work.. Woukd like to know when someone will send me a new one or send me a return address so we can get another\\npiece of worthless junk\\ncrap it was weighted\\nBroke the day we got it. Thin plastic.\\nPencil boxes were open and pencils strewn all over. Many tips had broken! Not satisfied\\n:(\\n\"The donut is super cute, but the Big Mouth Toys customer service is terrible. It was a week and a half late so I did not get the product in time to enjoy it for a trip I went on and when I contacted the company they were of no help. They only tracked my package (which I had already done). They are unreliable, they did not get back to me for days and they did not get their products out to me when it was stated they would. I do not recommend Big Mouth Toys\"\\nThe balloons didn\\'t seal so they were leaking out and I had to tie most of them by hand which was a pain  I wouldn\\'t buy this again from this company\\nDidn\\'t squirt. Don\\'t waste your money! I would have given no stars if it was an option.\\n\"I thought this was a really awesome toy from the looks, my son absolutely loves gears.  I was extremely disappointed with the actual reality.  The gears don\\'t really function as gears so much as stacking pieces.  It\\'s not possible for my son to operate this manually which is really what he wants to do--turn the gears.  Last, the pegs on the legs are so close together only specific pieces fit.  they pretty much just fall to pieces. Overall it was like the designer had an idea of how gears worked but never actually SEEN a gear in person.  My son got frustrated very quickly, and I felt bad for causing it.  The best I could do was help him make connected &#34;wheels&#34; out of the gears and roll them around.<br /><br />I really feel with a redesign you could make this one really awesome toy, but as it is, it\\'s garbage. I would not recommend this at all.\"\\nThe worst product i ever purchased! most of the them fell apart when i opened package. as a result most of our little guests didn\\'t get it as a party favor. eh! can i get a refund!!!!\\n\"Very poor quality.  Velcro fell off of many pieces after only a week.  Fruits and vegetables are made out of a very thin plastic, piece had rips and dents in the plastic only after two uses.  The knife that comes with the set is very flexible and unable to cut some of the pieces.  I previously had a food play set from Melissa and Doug that was exceptional quality and lasted for a very long time.\"\\n\"My son loves this drone! But it is a money pit! We ordered one and it quit working about a week later. But my son loved it so much that we decided to return it, order another one and give it another chance. When that one broke down, it was just because of a small part that we were able to order from Amazon as well. But then it was another part, and another part and so on. Now, 6 weeks later, it is not working, it is too late to return it and we have wasted about $100. Definitely not worth it!\"\\n\"The seller didn\\'t do anything wrong, it\\'s the product that SUCKS!! Way overpriced for the little cheap junk that you get. If it wasn\\'t that I promised my 4yo these, I wouldn\\'t have wasted my money on this. My advice is, don\\'t waste any money on these...They\\'re worth .50 cents max from the vending machines.\"\\nSmaller than I expected and the door you open to get the money out the tab broke on 2 of the 3 I ordered\\nI can\\'t believe I spent money on this POS... the crank doesn\\'t work and the boot has to be swung manually to make it kick the bucket (I had to bend the pole it\\'s on to even get it to be close enough to kick it). It constantly fell apart each time we tried to add more pieces. I put this away after 1 day of frustration and my son hasn\\'t asked to play with it since.\\n\"I purchased these based on the great reviews I saw on her, however they were falling apart right after opening the package. I plan to return them\"\\n\"DO NOT buy this product it\\'s a total waste of money !!  When I received my package they were broke in half. They deserve zero stars but, I had to  give them one star in order to post my review. The only positive thing was the quick delivery.\"\\nThese are the junk cards they cant sell off without them being in bulk...\\n\"The BOX?! You can\\'t give this as a gift. The box is so generic looking, it looks like something you got at a swap meet. It\\'s BRIGHT pink with white hearts all over it and just plain cheap looking. Such a bummer cuz the drone is probably great. But I needed to give this to 14 year old boy as a gift. Nope, can\\'t do it.\"\\nNothing but dupes\\n\"I bought two of these floats because it seemed like a good deal.  Blew them up and we loved them.....until the seams on the arms split after about 5 uses at the most. They were used normally, not abused in anyway and part of the time by children.  If you can get yourself balanced just right, and don\\'t have any children in your pool causing waves you can use it without the arms but not very easily.\"\\n\"Terrible!!!  These are not the brand &#34;Bunch o Balloons&#34; as advertised or as indicated in the photo.  These are some knock off and THEY DON\\'T WORK AT ALL! The water squirts out of them the the minute they come off the straws leaving you with a pile of un-used water balloons.  I was able to save maybe 15 of the 100 balloons but only because I tied the few that filled with waster as fast as I could. (and that was also after I tried to put the un-used balloons back on the straws the refill them--what a hassle!!) I\\'ve used the brand &#34;Bunch o Balloons&#34; before and they truly work.  Unfortunately, these just aren\\'t the real deal.  Save yourself the money, hassle and the frustration and don\\'t bother even trying these things.\"\\nReally doesn\\'t transform if Ya ask me. Smaller in size then I expected.. shipping was more then the toy\\nThere was no doll included!\\nOrdered for my daughters birthday party. ALL of the lollipops were broken upon arrival! Waste of money!\\nVery misleading. Paid $9.75 for one mini LPS bag. Very disappointed as were my kids....\\n\"Very poor performance!  Paper kept sticking and jamming. A couple of adults decided it was the child\\'s inability to use correctly, and it jammed on them too.  Wouldn\\'t recommend.\"\\nCheap\\n\"very bad quality. the tracks are weak and loose. the track adaptors are very weak also so the connection to our another track master is easily separated, very loose. and these tall supporters are loose also and move frequently. Even more, our Thomas train (fisher price brand) doesn\\'t move up smoothly. I have autistic child and I know he will be frustrated seeing the tracks and the other parts falling and disconnecting. I regret not reading the reviews before buying. I trusted fisher price.\"\\n\"The balls are filled with water and one of them was cracked, broken and empty and could not even be used.\"\\n\"It looks good. Nice detail- light plastic- basic remote. Mine came damaged, cracked in the rear near the sensors-  wouldn\\'t turn on even after full charged battery-possibly damaged before packaging.. This item is not exchangeable and they offered a gift card .um no! But.. Eventually after my second call to have return $ adjusted to what I paid - I got a full refund. Slightly nerve racking! But my poor sad son, was his birthday present..Though I\\'m sure when you get one that works- it could be fun. Who wouldn\\'t love a toy RC Ship\"\\nPrice way to high!\\nIt leaked air\\nJunk....returned it.  Do not buy.  Better quality at Dollar Store.\\nThis lunchbox is VERY poorly made. One of the zippers broke off literally the first time we unzipped it and the zipper is sewn so badly that it will barley go around one of the corners.  I would totally return it if I hadn\\'t already written my son\\'s name on it!\\n\"I am might be a little unfair here. The blocks work (more or less) and they are cheaper than the original Lego, but not so cheap to justify their low quality. I would not recommend them.\"\\n\"Yep, just like everyone else said...No cups! So unless you are okay with getting just the utensils, plates and napkins...I would suggest buying from someone else!\"\\nThe balance piece doesn\\'t even fit in the base. Get one from somewhere else.\\nWorked for a few days than nothing. What a waste of money. Very disappointed.\\nI paid $170 and it doesn\\'t even work. Even tried new batteries. Should of mentioned that. ESP if I\\'m paying that much. Very upset\\nyou can not choose the  color floaty you get.<br />I wanted a blue one I git a orange. ugh.<br /><br />buyer beware\\nWould not buy first run and they front one lots it\\'s pin that holds them together\\nReceived these bottles in plain white instead of assorted colors as described.\\n\"I am really disappointed with this mat.... I really love this character and i really love the art i had to buy it the minute i saw it. I have owned it for less then a month and its already starting to fray around the edges. I attached a few photos of a few bad spots but this is pretty much all the way around :-(<br /><br />I really wish the quality was better, i keep this mat in a tube whenever i am not playing, i am always careful when i roll it up and put it away, and still this is happening.\"\\n\"Would NOT turn off. After replacing the batteries when they finally died, it never worked again. I ended up throwing it away because it held water and I was worried about bacteria and mold growing.\"\\n\"Don\\'t waste your money on this crap! It is just a red foam ball with a slit on one side so that you can &#34;try&#34; to fit it onto your nose. How is the product supposed to remain in place? Now that I have these 12 of these things in my possession, I am wondering if returning it is worth the price of shipping considering that I only paid about $5 for them. I guess that I will just have to use them to throw at children, and hopefully the children will laugh!\"\\nvery cheap and my cat is terrified of it. SO not worth the money.\\nI love Tinkertoys and my kids were very excited when we got this. Sadly it was a huge disappointment! My box received was missing 22 vital pieces (eyes etc. everything in my pic surrounded by red). I am disgusted by this evident lack of integrity and gave 1 star only because I had to. I will change my review if sent the missing items :-(\\n\"Hat came crushed, it\\'s super cheap material...would not recommend\"\\nThey sound was so faint you could barely hear the the person on the other line at all! :(\\nNOT ASSEMBLED AT ALL!!!!  Do not buy unless you want to spend an hour of your life guessing how to put it together. Not assembled and no instructions\\nI ordered Crayola brand because I know it is good quality. What I received was a brand called Prang. Very crappy quality and not eligible for return. Will never order again.\\n\"I tried to put this on my phantom and the minute I did, one of the retaining sides for the camera lens broke off. From the start of trying to install this it was very clear that it was not going to fit properly. I applied very little pressure and twist it to try and make it fir around the lens of the camera and the minute I did one of the retaining sides for the camera lens cover snapped off, rendering the entire product useless and me not being able to use it in any capacity.    To me it seemed a little sketchy considering that it is suppose to protect the camera lens and keep the gimbal steady.\"\\nWill be returning. Not for kids- the hats are huge!!\\nReceived ours today and is not the black one we ordered and my little girl starts school tomorrow and now has the wrong Bookbag and we don\\'t have time to order another one!!\\nThese shoes fell apart withing ONE HOUR of my daughter wearing them indoors. The zip tie holding the decorations broke and the silver &#34;sticker&#34; acting as the inside sole began to peel up from the toe almost instantly.  Very poorly made.\\n\"I bought it for my niece and shipped it down to Dominican Republic and when she opened the package the thing was broke, i mean it didn\\'t work with the voice reconigtion and she had to open it with a tool. She was so excited about having a diary nobody could open  :(:(\"\\nI was soooo excited to buy this for my son. We got it opened it and used it one time he LOVED it. After the second use the thing quit working on us. I\\'ve tried contacting the manufacturer but they sent a battery and then stop writing back to me. Amazon definitely got me taken care of but I\\'m a little disappointed that it didn\\'t take long to mess up.\\n\"didn,t work\"\\n\"This is cheap, flimsy, and unsafe. I bought it because it was small and I was going to keep it inside. It is so small that it\\'s almost to small for an average size 14 month old. Also it is very unstable I wouldn\\'t let my child play on it unless I was holding onto it so it doesn\\'t tip over. I would never recommend this to anyone.\"\\n\"The plastic latch on the side did not fit correctly, so any kind of jolt (like a ball hitting the rim), sent the basket shooting down to the lowest height. The net is also tedious to put on, and came undone and frayed quickly. I sent it back for a full refund.\"\\n\"Horrible, very dented!\"\\n\"The cars that I received look nothing like the picture. Now, don\\'t get me wrong...I love myself a cool, racing minivan, but the box-shaped cars that I received aren\\'t exactly every kid\\'s idea of a race car. If you order this, beware, because you might receive miniature Scion xBs. I\\'m requesting a replacement and, hopefully, I receive the advertised item.\"\\nThis toy looked great when I was shopping my daughter was so happy to get it she had so much fun making it until she got sick she though up every where\\n\"This hat is cute, but is HUGE. I could not use it on my daughter\\'s head for her birthday because it looked ridiculous. It was fine as a decoration, but I had really hoped to take some pictures with her wearing a birthday hat.\"\\nI spent twenty some dollars on this and as soon as I put batteries in it made loud noise like gears were shot and smelt like rubber burning.\\nReally made cheap the handle broke in 3 days the lids broke and won\\'t close properly and not easy for a child of 4 to use. One week it went in the trash...\\n\"The item being delivered is NOT like the item in the picture. It is very small and no where in the item description does it state 24 months as the tag on the item does. Also it does NOT have a pocket in front, or side ties!! More like a flat piece of vinyl with a hole cut in it. Also the pattern printed is not like the picture.\"\\n\"The battery compartment isn\\'t sealed, so water gets in there and not only makes them stay on, but causes the batteries to leak and rust.  Even after drying them out and putting in new batteries, they still don\\'t light up.\"\\n\"Had hole in it first day, kids didn\\'t care for it. Sucks\"\\nFlip of death after three flights. Waste of time and money. Sorry.\\nBroke on the seam after 5 days of lite use. Second one in a row!!!!\\nhappy with the dolls my little one loves the 3 inch ones.. i was not happy with 4 of the same doll out of 6 dolls.. very disapointed\\n\"(1) Before ordering the RYO Sudoko, I called Amazon and I asked if I was receiving a new machine and the answer was YEs, The Sudoko I received was made in 2005 and was nothing like the one i already possessed. So, I called and they sent me aUPS to return it which I did.<br />The RYO model I received was an out of date machine (2005) and compared to the current one i already have was simply not as easy to use as the one that I currently have. (2) when i received the sudoko I ordered using Amazon, it was a USED model and it DID not work and because its something that I received via Amazon, it  definitely soured my view that Amazon would allow something like that. I have had the newer model for many years and I wanted a backup machine because I use it every day and always on the thousands of air flights I have had in my life.\"\\nThis was the biggest waste of $$$$ took forever to put together. Didn\\'t stay inflated for more than  2 days.\\nGot it yesterday and one\\nThis was the ugliest owl I have ever seen. I was very disappointed.\\nThese dresses were like paper.

Tried multiple known good chargers and still nothing.\\n\"This picture is very deceiving!<br />The cake topper is only maybe 4&#34; tall and about 2&#34; wide at best.<br />The graphics image on the cake topper lack quality.  The images had gaps in portions of the helmets, necks, arms, and legs (meaning you could see right through it).<br />The action figures are just slightly shorter. This decoration would probably work well for a small personalized kids sized cake but is too small for a large cake.\"\\n\"Please note that you only get one.  I was under the impression that you get all 4. (Especially for the price!) they didn\\'t ask which one. It\\'s adorable, but very pricey for just one tiny giraffe.\"\\nJust one?????

Very frustrating.\"\\npiece of **** it didnt work.. not worth returning. it is stupid dont waste your money\\nreturned game as it was broken and missing pieces\\n\"DO NOT BUY THIS.  You cannot connect it to the drone that it claims that it is for.  The battery has the wrong shaped connector so there is no way to connect it to the Syma drone.  We returned it.  The only good thing is with Prime, there are free returns.\"\\nit sucks it lasts about 2 min\\nCute? Yes. Kinda looks like the photo? Yea. Cotton? Absolutely NOT. This is an acrylic at best. Feels very plastic like. We heat tested a strand and it melted. Skin irritation from synthetic fibers is a problem in my home which is why we purchased this- it claims to be cotton. Just a warning incase you or your baby have allergies.\\n\"I should have read the reviews more closely.  This is a fascinating toy for a few months.  It took me a few minutes to get the hang of placing the magnet, but after some practice, I could do it every time.  However, after a few months, it stops working.  I just spent 30 minutes trying to get it to levitate, but the field is not stable enough and the helper system has apparently broken down, just like so many other reviewers said it would.<br /><br />If you want one of this things, just be sure to return it before the return policy expires, otherwise, shortly after, it will stop working.\"\\n\"My almost 3 years old son just discovered the octonauts cartoon and loves it (not sure how educational it is though...) I recently took away his pacifier and promised him a gift and this I thought would have been a good choice. He loved it but Maybe he is too young for it, not sure, but the parts keep on falling off, and we already lost the turtle. It comes with captn, kwazii and 3 &#34;creatures&#34;. But no PESO!! The top red thingy you see on top in the picture comes off and &#34;talks&#34; when pressed,you can hear Captn and Kwazii talking, I with they had the little &#34;creature report&#34; song, but it doesnt.

Sooo not worth the price!!\"\\nI bought an 11 inch plushie and got a 7 inch talkable sadness doll... Seriously?\\n\"I will admit I\\'m responsible for buying without reading. What I thought were three turtles ( as shown in the picture ) turned out to be a single green turtle. The only reason I didn\\'t pack it up and send it back is my granddaughter was present when the box was opened and immediately said it was hers. To add insult to injury, once the batteries are in, it hardly moves in the water.<br />This product is mediocre at best. I do not recommend it or this company. This is the first and last time I buy from these people!\"\\n\"I know that ordering fake poop online is potentially disappointing, but this exceeded my expectations in regards to it\\'s failure.

One minute it\\'s on, the next it\\'s off. Battery will NOT charge. Can not be replaced. I wasted my money. What\\'s worse??? All the apps we\\'ve bought online can only be used in up to 5 of the leap frog units. We\\'ve bought 5 units now...2 broken screens and now this dead in water machine. So not only am I out of the hundreds I spent on app, but this money is gone too! I\\'ve read online this is a VERY common problem. Don\\'t buy this! Leapfrog products are cool when they work. My kids love them....but it\\'s like the company makes them so that with one drop, it\\'s dead! Who makes a kid product that has a screen that can not be replaced? Leapfrog. Who makes a product that has a glitchy rechargeable battery that can\\'t be replaced? Leapfrog. They get you between a rock and a hard place because you\\'ve already spent so much on apps, games and books you HAVE to buy another when it breaks. The bleeding is over here! Not one penny more will ever be spent on a single leapfrog product! Ps when you call the company, they are unwilling to help. They KNOW they already got your money....so they do not care.\"\\nPoor balance. Poor response to controller. Bad product.\\n\"Yuck. Tell me exactly how an entire tray of cupcakes can go into the machine and disappear? All we could figure is that it somehow fell into the heating element, so we threw it away to be safe.

Don\\'t waste your money - Go for the old fashioned fire hazard where you actually knew where the danger was and could avoid it.\"\\nWas very cheaply made and the batteries died very quickly.\\n\"I would never buy from this company again! The wires to the battery were not connected and I could not find the wire to hook to the charger. I remove the body and found the battery installed backwards because the battery wire were not center to the battery so it could be correctly installed. Also the self centering spring for the left hand controller is broke or missing. If you read the instructions, they must have been written at a second grade level. I would have returned this product but I had it for a month and was just now getting the chance to try it out. I rarely write reviews but in this case I felt compelled to do so. Very dissatisfied!\"\\nAbsolute Garbage. I purchased it as a first wallet for my 6 yr old who asked for a Batman wallet. I didn\\'t want to spend $25 with gougers but in the end that would\\'ve been better. This is by far the cheapest piece of garbage I have ever purchased on Amazon and I spend a lot of money on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money elsewhere. This thing is literally a cheap piece of material sewn together and not that well cause the stitching was coming apart when we received it. I cant even tell you what the material is. It seems like the padded white material they pack electronics in. You get what you pay for so use me as an example and don\\'t bother here. Lesson learned! Wow I just cant believe what garbage this thing is. It should be illegal to sell something of this quality or should I say lowest of quality! Gabage Garbage Garbage!\\nNever got to use it.

You\\'ll start to think the puzzle is relatively easy only to find out that those pieces that fit so well are actually the wrong pieces.  This goes for the border pieces and inside ones too.  We had to redo the border 3 times and we are still not sure if it\\'s correct.  It looks right, but it looked right the first and second time too!  It is so frustrating!  Puzzles are supposed to be challenging but they should also be fun which this is not.<br /><br />Don\\'t this puzzle for the following reasons:<br />1.  Pieces are too similar and will fit into multiple areas.  Don\\'t torture yourself.<br />2.  Picture on box does not accurately reflect puzzle picture.<br />3.  Pieces start to peel after so many times of undoing pieces that you thought fit.\"\\nIt didn\\'t keep the air .\\nPlastic food was from the cheapest junkiest quality of plastic<br />Im really upset<br />Not at all as shown on picture<br />Dont u know wed rather pay that much more and get a quality item...<br />Besides..its already not a good price for the given quality<br />Looks like it really wont last long...<br />And thats before ive opened.<br />Total weight of all set weighs what well know brands tiny food sets.<br />A shame<br />Not happy\\nUgly product.\\nThe product I received was a regular grune figure with normal mummra snake logo.

However, like other reviewers, the sensor is much too sensitive.  He tried to play the game but without him even moving the snake would pop up.  We even tried putting it in a room with no one there, and it popped up regardless.  Please don\\'t buy this toy.  I wish I didn\\'t.  Thanks Fotorama for making my kid cry on their birthday.\"\\n\"Very disappointed in these.  I ordered 4 different ones expecting them to be the same quality of one I had seen that a co-worker had.  He said he got his about 20 years ago from a friend.  HIS animal magnet was made of a very sturdy, thick velour like material.  HIS had very big magnets in the feet so that you could actually stand it up and position the animal in different standing positions.  THESE animals are made of a very cheap almost furry shammy like material.  WAY too flimsy to have the legs actually support the creature in any meaningful positions.  The magnets are very small in the feet and there is one in the chest.  You would think this would be a good thing but the legs are so flimsy that the magnets keep pulling the legs into the chest.  CHEAP CHEAP and way too expensive for that!!!  For the price I was expecting the quality of the one my co-worker showed me.  If I had paid .99 cents for these I would have kept them, but at $5.00 or $6.00 each???  NOPE.  They look much higher quality in the pictures than they actually are.\"\\n\"I thought it was great at first, but then it started beeping and it wouldn\\'t stop.

Yes I bought this from warehouse deals but it said only the box would be damaged, nothing about missing pieces. It looks like someone had this and they basically bought this one and removed all the little pieces to replace on theres. Its missing the dial, roller, domed lid, gear shift, spinner, rear handle, no screws or washer. So the only pieces that are in the box was the body/chassis, wheels, and front handle. My question is how the returns center could resell this as everything included in the box. When you open it up I new right away since there was no little plastic package with little pieces to fit it together and if you look at the picture everything for the baby to play with is not on the body. They were removed and it was resold.<br /><br />**I love the item if all the pieces would of been there. Its like giving a sucker to a child but without the actually candy part, just the stick.<br />The item itself Im sure it great and Im sure my 8 month old son would love it. The items great and I will go to wal mart or re order but the experience was awful. Im mostly upset that the returns center couldnt just look at the item and make 100% sure all the pieces were returned. They should go back and see who returned it and re-charge them for this item since no one would be able to put this together with out these missing pieces.\"\\nDidn\\'t know what to expect from a Rubik\\'s Brand cube.<br />You can get much better cubes for a lower price.

So unfortunately I am NOT very satisfied\\ngets tangled extremely easily. Was not able to use.\\n\"Advertised as a party favor, however the packaging design is very poor. Multiple pieces of the plane breaks free of the surrounding packaging when handled (even very gently) making it impossible to be placed freely in a party favor bag.\"\\n\"This game is a joke. I don\\'t mean that figuratively. The game is about making a joke. The joke is that you\\'re saying something transgressive that you probably would have never thought to say on your own. The first time you play, if you\\'re not super uptight about being politically correct (though, I dunno, maybe we all should be?), it\\'s pretty hilarious. The second time it\\'s less funny, just like a joke is less funny when you hear it again. After that, you\\'ve already heard this joke. Maybe you can revive the joke a bit by telling it to some new people, playing it with some new friends, but it will still never be the first time you heard the joke. Then after a while, the joke is just super old. It\\'s as funny as any joke you\\'ve heard 10+ times before, meaning, not at all.<br /><br />Seeing as there\\'s no game here, just a joke, there\\'s very little point in playing it after your first or second time.\"\\nI bought two packs. 6 of the pencils had holes.

My kid likes to push the bus however he couldn\\'t play with it because of the tiny rotary wheels in the front. Also once you turn it on, the bus keeps on running with a loud annoying music, would have liked if it stops after minute or so.\"\\nThis Huffy Green Machine was purchased for my grandsons 9th birthday in July. He has only had it for a month and the back wheels have already split and are broken. He can\\'t even enjoy it. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.\\nPoor quality. Returned. Disappointed.\\n\"I am amazed that this plane received good reviews.  This was the worst purchase decision I have made in years.  It says &#34;RTF&#34; but it still requires a lot of work / tweaking and the manual is not completely updated.  Example:  it says the put a paperclip in the &#34;Bind&#34; button to Bind the receiver to the Transmitter but in fact the button is labeled &#34;Link&#34;.  There are many many other examples where the manual is not clear and they expect you to figure it out.  The manual needs to be completely rewritten.  In addition, when you need help, then GOOD LUCK!  The technical support (217) 398-8970 number, I waited for an hour on hold and no one picked up when I needed help.  I spent 20 hours trying to get the plane tto work and still the transmitter was not getting the elevators, allerons, rudder, etc. to work.  And, how about having a &#34;How to put together your plane&#34; video on the web site?  And, how about starting your manual with an explanation of what the parts the plane are?  This would be nice as Flyzone should start from ground zero and shouldn\\'t expect everyone to be an experienced RC plane person.  This company owes me.\"\\nMoss balls were dead\\n\"Not very good, holds air but does not look good as a ice cream cone, bad colors, etc.\"\\nI\\'ve tried several times to get my family or friends to get into this game and nobody wants to play it.

I was hesitant after reading some reviews but bought it for my sons birthday anyway.  Big mistake.  I made sure my 8 year old and his 6 year old cousin were super careful but after 3 hours there was a hole on one of the foot holds.  Customer service was quick and responsive and I received a replacement slide in a little over a week.  Well after a few hours of gentle play the same thing happened so I will be returning for a refund.  It\\'s too bad because my son loved it while it worked.\\nThis item came broken.

I know you get what you pay for and this is a prime example of that statement. I should have went with the more expensive ones but the reviews seemed good on these.... And to return them I will be charged shipping which is not much less than what I paid so I won\\'t return them.... Live and learn.

Some lower and upper case letters are not compatible to use for sentence and word forming (the UC Y is the same size as the LC y). The LC q is weird looking the seller responded and said they made a new LC q but the one I got was the old style. I am very disappointed in this product to say the least. I can\\'t believe that it has a high rating from teachers (or so they say they are). Some letters are interchangeable like M and W.

The Uncle Milton Star Theater Home Platinum is without a doubt the stupidest thing I have ever spent money on in my entire life! My son is interested in the stars and wanted a projector. So I went to an educational toy shop. The packaging looked legit and I figured why not, they only wanted forty dollars and it would support the local economy. Unfortunately I did not have access to the Amazon reviews...<br /><br />The packaging and images on this site are very deceptive. The globe looks dark and I foolishly expected this to project stars as little pinholes of light on the ceiling. It does the opposite. The globe is clear and the stars are printed on it. The end result projects a dull glow with the &#34;stars&#34; as blurry dark globs. Imagine drawing a few black dots on a nightlight-- this is effect you will get. The text is not legible on the ceiling and its near impossible to locate any recognizable constellations. The glowing &#34;stars&#34; are pointless. The meteor wand is laughable. The whole thing feels cheap and a ready to fall apart at a moments notice.  I didn\\'t even bother with the included CD. My son lost interest within 60 seconds. I don\\'t even feel right giving this to goodwill. I think its only place is in the trash.\"\\n\"This was our son\\'s big 4th birthday gift.  He was super excited to get it.  However,  after less than 2 months of normal play by a year old and 18 month old,  the plastic has cracked and it is broken.  I should never have paid $50 for plastic,  but I thought this company had a good reputation and made toys that could withstand play. So, so disappointed over here.\"\\n\"Cheap POS.

I\\'m asking you as a reputable retailer, that you would raise the question to this manufacturer of this depiction of animal abuse really necessary?  I strongly believe this to be offensive and as a person involved in supporting abused animals,  this be addressed as inappropriate.  The repercussions of such an act is extremely damaging, permanent and are causing painful death of animals.  We have responsibilities as adults to remove such depictions that can leave negative impressions on children who could see this as an acceptable act.  I would ask you to please consider either dropping this product, or raising this question to the makers of this game.\"\\n\"Very disappointed in the quality of this chair. Maybe a defect?

Found out if I pushed on one of the chips on the front, something I learned from a youtube video using silicone tubing and a rubber band, I was able to get it to run for a while until the (poorly) surface mounted chip finally stopped working right, probably 12 more flights.

It\\'s not a perfect circle and never was and doesn\\'t hold air.\"\\nIt was OK it is for children not for adults!\\n\"First of all, I paid for shipping and then realized another company sells the same topper with Amazon Prime, so make sure you search carefully at your options.  Secondly, the instruction sheet (which was fraught with grammar errors) said to just put the image in the freezer for a couple of minutes and it should pop right off.  I followed the instructions exactly and the image didn\\'t pop off.  The sheet said if 2 minutes didn\\'t do the trick, put it in for 1 more minute.  I did that.  Still didn\\'t even come close to coming off--think of a paper-thin layer of play dough that crumbles when you try to peel off the entire image.  The instructions said &#34;In extremely dry or extremely humid conditions you may need to take extra precautions.&#34;  But they do not specify what those extra precautions are--basically it\\'s their way of avoiding an obligatory refund.  Our cake plan was ruined since I had kept the image stored till an hour before the party so it would be fresh.

The toy does not provide an interactive experience as advertised rather it rolls erratically on the ground does not realize it is against a wall or other object and falls over constantly.  The remote control is flimsy and provides very little control of the toy except making its eyes read and moving the mouth however directional control is virtually nonexistent.  Battery power does not last more than 20 mins and then you have to recharge for another hour and a half.

They do not fit an average adult-infact they hardly fit the smallest head of a child in my 3-4 year old preschool class. They are awful quality, fraying, and are SO small. I will not be using them and am very disappointed. I ordered on July 11th amazon prime and not not even get them until the 18th. Overall AWFUL and worst thing I have ever gotten on amazon.\"\\n\"Ripped off. Came with NO DARTS. No upper Leg Armor, and the icing on the cake? No bloody battery port cap.

A seam on the dress ripped and the cuffs ripped off of the cape.  Could be so cute but unfortunately have to return due to quality!\"\\nWay too small....\\nHorrible... The toys itself was dust and didn\\'t even work. The box was damagend and retaped... Looked like it it was in a basement for 20 years.  The shipping box was fine.  I would not even give it a start.\\nThe duckies don\\'t stay afloat an they till over bad review for this item\\n\"stop powering up, even after keep charging it. I want a replacement or a refund.

It was a bit disappointing!\\nBoth back wheels stop working\\n\"My son wanted this train so much and when he earned the money to buy it he was so excited and counted down the days until it\\'s delivery. We received it today and he was over the moon it came a day early, unfortunately his excitement dwindled when it worked for 2 seconds when the battery was placed in it and then it stopped and no longer works. I figured the battery was old but even with a new pack of batteries it doesn\\'t work anymore.

Pusher okay but rack is bent.\\nIts a fake card and its not even a secret  rare. ..dont waste your money\\n\"This was advertised as blind box of 6....wrong! Such a waste of money. Poorly advertised and I spare you the horror of buying 1 FIGURE. And to think, this one small box would cost you 49.99??? Enough said...\"\\nMy son had this product all of two days before it broke. He had been very gentle with it but one complete blade assembly denigrated in flight. I returned it to Amazon and that experience was great they gave me no hassle. And I ordered a different product and is working fine too this day. You know the rule if twenty of this same item were sitting on a table I\\'d pick the defective one.\\nVery complex.  It\\'s like going to business class and not enjoying the education.  All most fell asleep reading the instructions.  Way over priced and not a good value.  It is so boring we didn\\'t even finish the game.  I would like to get my money back.  Read Robert T. Kiyoski\\'s books.  They have much more content and are fun to read.\\n\"These have been up in my son\\'d room for about 2 months now. Mater is still up there like a champ but all the other decals from the Lightening sheet are falling off. Lightening never stuck from the beginning.

Now that the others are falling as well, I am giving this one star and saying don\\'t buy!\"\\n\"Ordered two boxes, but have only received one.  Unable to find who I should talk to about missing order.\"\\nthis bear was not stuffed well it lips are loose and the construction feel cheap. Decent price for size but quality just isnt there.\\n\"I liked the idea of attaching it to a headband to make it easier to wear. However, the Item showed up bent in different areas causing it to actually be harder to wear. It wouldn\\'t stand upright.

And they broke anytime they hit anything.\\nWould not hold air after a week of use\\n\"Bought product for weekend company expecting one use per comments on ratings.  Did not even get that: could never get water jets to adjust properly to hit slide area. Complete waste of time and money, plus disappointed grandkids.

This is not worthy at all.\\nPurchased for a pool party and maybe 3 out of 24 lasted the hour and a half in the pool.  Many didn\\'t even last 10 minutes and a few even came apart after only a few pumps!  The kids loved them but were quite frustrated that they kept breaking.  Great fun while they worked but should have just bought more water balloons instead!\\nThis is made out of cheap foam and it looks nothing like the picture. It easily breaks and the paint looks like cheap spray paint.\\nPoorly made.  Smelled funny.  Not in boxes as shown.  Went straight into the trash can.\\n\"Got the product 5 weeks after the order if made. I was really anxious and excited to open the mail but got really disappointed. These toys are in extremely inferior quality. The paint messed up everywhere on the toy, and it dropped a lot when I was arranging them. One of them definitely can\\'t stand by itself. Poor quality for sure and the worst collection I bough for minions.\"\\nVery cheap made product.  Drone does not fit inside as shown in picture.\\nI bought this product TWICE and could never get it to work.  I used every time of bubble solution and still nothing.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  BUY THE CHEAP ONES FROM WALMART.\\npvc sent only half.\\nIt broke within 2 weeks\\nThe remote control that I received was totally faulty. And could not really fly this thing. On a rare occasion it works.\\nTerrible quality. It broke within 5 minutes of opening. My son was devastated.\\nBought  this 4 my daughter every small pocket small in size over all\\n\"Worst purchase ever... The fillings are sealed with little plastic bags that can easily break and make a terrible noise when handled. It is akin to the noise produced when handling a diaper. If you like playing with diapers, these could be for you.\"\\n\"Worthless.  Of the ~80 or so balloons on each bunch, roughly half would fill, and those only 1/2way or so before dropping off.  Then the seal didn\\'t hold so they leaked what little water was in them immediately.  Had to have five adults all grab the balloons and tie them shut in a vain attempt to make them usable.  Switched to &#34;name brand&#34; balloons and they worked perfectly.\"\\nCheap. The lid broke after one day.\\nThese are all fake the fluffy baby is isn\\'t even fluffy!  don\\'t buy!!\\n\"This was supposed  to be a new unit purchased with the frustration free packaging. When i got the unit it was obvious that it was used and repackaged. There were scratches under the slide mechanism indicating it was primed several times, the barrel was loose and wobbled, 4 of the 6 darts had impact scratches on the orange head, the barrel release button is stiff and scratched, also several nicks and scratches along the barrel and handle. I am very disappointed because this unit was supposed to be new. If it was marked used i wouldn\\'t have minded but I paid for a brand new blaster and got a use (functional) unit instead. I think something has to be done.\"\\nDisappointed in the crayon. They seem to have too much wax and the colour is not as vibrant.\\nThis is just thin plastic\\nVery small plane. I really cant see it\\nUsed the slide 3 times- small holes and broken stitched allowed water to seep inside slide- ran blower for 5 hours to ensure slide dried properly and still ended up with a moldy mess- warranty company &#34; toy inquiry&#34; was horrible and told me mold was &#34;cosmetic&#34;. Do no recommend. The store I purchased it from took it back thank god!\\n\"These might be OK inside, but I bought them for outside.  All the &#34;flags&#34; have come off the &#34;rope&#34;.  The flags are made of a very thin plastic, that  tears right off in any kind of breeze.\"\\nStayed inflated for one day. Very disappointed.\\n\"Good idea, crappy reality. Arms aren\\'t strong enough to handle a crash. Broke an arm on my maiden flight????\"\\nThis should be no stars.. Would not stand up in pool.. This was a complete bummer!\\n\"I bought this product and the inner tube blew at the seam only after 20 minutes after using it for the first time. We were just sitting in the tube not even moving when it blew. I weigh 160 and my fiance weighs 185. This product only lasted 20 minutes!!!! I tried to call Intext customer support. It took me 10 minutes to explain to them that I wanted to talk about the &#34;River Run II&#34; product. They had no idea what the &#34;River Run II&#34; product was and I had to google the product to find the item number to give them before I could even talk about what happened. They told me that they do not warranty their products and that they wouldn\\'t send me a new River Run II or any patching materials to attempt to fix the problem. They said that they couldn\\'t help me, the refused to let me talk to a manager, and they told me to feel free to write a negative review on their product.\"\\n\"I had this thing for maybe a couple weeks when it broke open a bit and leaked the sticky stuff on my couch, thankfully only a small drop. I threw it away and won\\'t be ordering again.\"\\nThe baby alien\\'s tail broke when I was loading it into the egg. The rubber they used for this is not what they should have used. The rubber was more on the plastic side which is why it snapped (rather than tore).\\n\"We received this as a gift, as I could see what this is a mile away and would never have purchased it myself -- especially for the price.  It\\'s a cheaply-made gimmick marketed to kids as a &#34;fun&#34; way to make homemade ice cream.  Ironically, it\\'s far easier and far less messy to just make homemade ice cream at in a &#34;real&#34; ice cream machine -- and the machines are about the same price.  The mix needed to make the ice cream is way over-priced and once we\\'ve used it up, we won\\'t be purchasing more.<br /><br />First, the instructions that come with this toy (and although it does, in fact, make real ice cream, it is absolutely a TOY) are awful.  You can get there eventually, but they\\'re difficult to follow for parents and children alike.  You can get there eventually, but the first time we used this, we spent more time trying to figure out how all the pieces fit than we did making the actual ice cream.<br /><br />My little girl had fun turning the crank for about 2 minutes before she tired of it.  But, as indicated in the instructions, she cranked for 10 minutes and ice cream did, in fact, come out.  But here\\'s the kicker:  Predictably, there\\'s very little payoff for the work done.  As one can expect, there is far less ice cream than the pictures indicate.  But even at that -- there is FAR, FAR less ice cream than the pictures indicate.  You get about 4 spoonfulls of ice cream after all your hard work.  That\\'s it.  My kids were very disappointed.<br /><br />And the mess.  Egads, the mess.  Granted, I encouraged my 10-year-old girl to do it all, and there were the spills that come with that.  But still.  This product is very messy to deal with.<br /><br />My suggestion is buy a real, non-toy home ice cream maker.  Get some good ice cream recipes and buy all the ingredients, and then teach your children (and yourself?) how to make real ice cream.  I\\'ve been making ice cream that way for two decades, and it\\'s a million times easier, a lot more fun for the kids, and nets a fraction of the mess, even if you allow your children to do all or most of the work.  AND those machines and recipes will net you at least a quart of ice cream (depending on your model and recipe), so there\\'s enough for everyone to enjoy a small bowl instead of merely a spoonful or two.<br /><br />If I had bought this myself, I\\'d return it for a full refund.  It\\'s garbage.  It\\'s going to end up in the &#34;donate to charity&#34; pile.\"\\n\"The one that I got worked for the first 3 charges, then after that the copter would not even take off after a charge\"\\nWill not float upright.

I would give it more stars, but I can\\'t see why Ganz has to do this to kids like me. I sometimes think that they don\\'t even care that a bunch of collectors are wasting their money on something that they wont even play with, and all the kids out there can hardly get a few. I am really disappointed in their attitudes about this, because I sent them an email complaining about it, and all they said was \\'We can not tell you exactly why we stopped making this product\\', which I translated as \\'Buzz off\\'. If any of you don\\'t agree with me, fine, but maybe people should take a moment to think if it\\'s right.\"\\n\"Nothing but static, broke my son\\'s heart not to be able to use them.\"\\n\"It died within 4 months of extremely light use.  It was not dropped or banged around, nothing spilled on it.<br /><br />We went to turn it on the other day and it wouldn\\'t turn on.  Changed the batteries, tried plugging it in using the adapter, nothing.<br /><br />For the time it was in use, it was great for little hands.  My son was able to pick up rapidly the coordination it took to play the games.  However, not worth the money for the console and games for a 4 month use.  Unfortunately it is also past the return date.<br /><br />Would not recommend.\"\\nDid not receive different cups as shown.received 4 of the same\\nReceived it and went to go get it filled and olaf had a hole!!! what a waste... it was an olaf party too....\\nReceived missing parts and doesn\\'t work.

It filled maybe 2/3 of the balloons initially and then about 15 to 20 min later that number dwindled down to about 14 balloons. It seems as though the o rings are too big and don\\'t have enough force to seal the balloon so the water just squirts out. Won\\'t but these again. Don\\'t waste your money.

I bought them for a grandchild\\'s birthday party and despite the parents helping the children the things just broke one after another.  The quality is terrible.  They also did not work well in the bubbles for various reasons but primarily because of their poor design.  Considering this was to be a major part of the kids entertainment it was very disappointing.  I would never recommend this product.\\nThis product leaves your hands stained.

Very disappointed.\\n\"Not pleased with the performance....after buying and charging 8 additional batteries I took the Syma clone out for some night flying out on the beach. The first flight went good, good flight characteristics, on the second flight I noticed some erratic movement.  Upon startup on the third flight one of the motors was spinning way too low, then a second motor started to do the same thing.  So after two flights it now sits on a shelf while I fly my DJI Phantom 1.1.1 which now has close to 300 flights without any issues.\"\\nMy Granddaughter Didn\\'t like the taste at all. This was a waste of money.\\nI was very disappointed in the quality for the price and will be returning this product. It looks like the props are gold glitter in the photo on website but they are only printed to look like gold glitter. The stickers are only small round labels that you usually find in the store for paper work. They do not look big enough strong enough to adhere the cut outs to the stick.

I was so excited to use this for a birthday this weekend but they\\'re just not worth it and now I\\'m out shipping cost to return as well.\\n\"Very disappointed in this product.

The first one I bought was damaged from the box! Thinking it was a manufacture\\'s defect, I returned it and bought a second. The second one tore after only fifteen to twenty minutes of use. It tore on the under side of one of the water strips. The three kids using it kids were supervised the entire time. There was no misuse.  They had fun while it lasted...I just wish it lasted longer than not even one full use. I am very disappointed.\"\\nthe drain hole in the bottom leaked from day 1.

Not sure if it is bad battery or bad charger, however Amazon refuses to do anything stating that this item is non-returnable.

Disappointed.\\n\"Terrible, cheaply made toy.  As others have said, you have to have to hit the launcher with just the right amount of force for it to work, which is touch to impossible for a little kid.  Furthermore, the gates at the end don\\'t stay in place.  First, you have to be very careful about setting them up and have a very light touch.

That said, for some reason all of the 3rd party sellers of this toy like to brand it as their own so you\\'re not going to the same item on one Amazon product page. Therefore you\\'re not going to see all the bad reviews on one page.<br /><br />[Good]<br /><br />It looks great, in pictures only.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Everything about this set is cheap. About the only thing that\\'s actually metal are the cymbals. Everything else is a combination of really cheap plastic and card board.<br /><br />Not all of the pieces are made well. One of the plastic pieces that holds a cymbal, wasn\\'t formed correctly so it didn\\'t hold the cymbal correctly.<br /><br />The whole thing is very fragile. This is stupid when it\\'s for a little kid banging on stuff.<br /><br />The instructions are near useless. It\\'s hard to see and there\\'s barely any text.<br /><br />[Verdict]<br /><br />Don\\'t waste your time with garbage. A real, durable drum set on Amazon starts at around one hundred and twenty dollars. A full set that looks like this toy, starts at around one hundred and seventy dollars.\"\\n\"Bought 2 units, to use one for a 200W solar system, and to have one as a spare for other projects. First one stopped working (no display) after about 2 weeks. Second one stopped working after about a week. Nice design with good specs, I just wish they were reliable.\"\\nAs others have mentioned this piece is very fragile and was broken within minutes of putting it on. Don\\'t waist your money.\\n\"Damaged packaging, clearly open and abused. Defeats the whole purpose and not what was described at all.\"\\nOrdered this to have bubbles for my daughters birthday pictures as well as use for her birthday party.  Plugged it in and nothing... didn\\'t even make a sound like it was trying.  Luckily I had a back up for her pictures but I am returning this and going a different route so I can have a bubble machine for her birthday in time.\\nThis mask is garbage.\\nIt does not stay together long. with the first pull or push it falls apart.\\n\"you get what you paid for ,better off spending more money and get the metal one\"\\n\"Don\\'t buy this!!!! Its sad because its really fast. For the price it seemed like a great setup but now i know why. First drive Lower A arm broke, ordered all aluminum steering to replace$$, Then the chassis cracked at the front making it weak so i purchased the carbon fiber big $$. It seemed ok at this point lots of power but it still had issues every drive (lower A arm pins would slide forward every other jump, dog bones would bend under the power esc would cut off even if i was just trying to stop and go in grass, wheels were always loose feeling) I kept a tool kit with me at all times. The final straw was the esc burnt out and a new one is half the price of the truck and all of this happened in 30 days? Parts are not available in hobby shops, you have to order and shipping is not cheap. I put as much into this truck as i paid for it and have a parts truck now. No truck is bullet proof so buy one you can get parts for locally.\"\\nThis did not include Bonus Zuma and Bonus Rocky as stated in the description!\\n\"Not what I expected, it said flask which it wasn\\'t.

Not only are they painted poorly, the colors are bleeding off  of the intended area, but they are different colors then what is even  available for season 3. For example Toastie Bread is only available in brown and orange. I received blue and green. The packaging was faded, scratched and partially opened upon receiving them.\"\\nDoes not fit on my Phantom 3.  So I returned for a refund.\\n\"Bought this to carry bills EXCLUSIVELY. As I carry a wallet for cards but prefer to keep cash in my front pants pocket, the idea of padding the clip with cards makes no sense to me. Neither does folding the bills for greater volume. Bottom Line: If you only have a few bills, the clip slides right off them. And no, you can\\'t adjust the pressure on the plastic (sorry, carbon fiber) clip itself. The etched design is nice.\"\\nI love Melissa & Doug products but every time I purchase a sound puzzle they do not work very well. This puzzle just randomly makes the sounds and does not make the sounds when you put the pieces in.\\n\"Do not waste your money. They ride up because they are not long enough, wrinkle because they are not wide enough. I tried everything to make this work.\"\\nThis cube broke in the first day my so had it. Very disappointed. Decided not to skip back as it would probably cost more in shipping than I spent on the item.\\n\"Horrible.  Out of the twelve dinos, we got only FOUR different species.

It\\'s super small, and sounds like a toy piano not a real one\"\\ndid not work\\nI bought a bunch of these to put money gifts for Christmas.  Complete garbage -- every single one of this broke and I had to throw them all away.  Don\\'t waste your money.\\n\"My daughter was so unhappy with this item and she is a child that is always happy with everything.  If I could have given it zero stars I would have.  The reason she wasn\\'t happy was when you open it up all the pages are white and blank.  She wanted some fun writing on it.  All because she found mine from 1982 and loved it.  I\\'ll admit that when I saw the blank pages, I thought, &#34;WTF?&#34;  Don\\'t buy it.  It is something you could make with a eliminator at a teacher store and it would look much nicer.\"\\nAweful quality\\n\"Not worth a penny - had to send it back for a refund, which I received quickly.\"\\nGot it today and after a look over 1 leg wasent stuffed and there was a hole in the tail. Luckily I can fix it my self but disappointed I have to. It is cute but wish I disowns have these defaults.\\nI do not recommend this toy. My seven month old stuck his index finger in one of the holes. It got stuck and was cutting off his circulation.\\ntoo small for that price\\nIt was a size small and the boot cover came ripped.\\n\"Arrived today, none of the images here are what you get. You don\\'t get 240 darts, that I guessed would be incorrect. You don\\'t get 20 red and 4 green. You get four packs of six knock off nerf mega darts that are all red, don\\'t whistle, and are poorly glued together. Don\\'t waste your money on these.\"\\nSmaller than expected and the weight limit is a joke. If ur child\\'s more than about 25 or 30 lbs this isn\\'t for u.\\n\"Pre-ordered a Brotherhood of Steel figure, only to find out that my order got changed to a super mutant. Had to cancel, very disappointed.\"\\nWorst toy ever it doesn\\'t make the forward sound and has very poor range and would keep stopping even though I held forward. This toy is just complete garbage do not buy\\nPurchased two boats and they did come so that one frequency controlled one boat and a different frequency for the other boat.<br />Purchased spare batteries.  All batteries charged and went to pond.<br />One boat worked for 10 minutes - and then nothing.  The other boat worked for a full battery and was fun - and then didn\\'t work with next charged battery.<br />Double checked all batteries charged.<br />Both boats do not work now.<br />Would highly recommend against purchasing.\\nTiny and cheaply made for the price\\n\"Wow, the quality was very poor and despite the new packaging I could swear this item was used it is so loose and brittle. Immediately one of the hands crumbled apart when I removed it to switch to his open gun hand. I\\'m quite disappointed and frankly surprised to get something from a Japanese company that is so crappy.\"\\nI thought it said 10 separete pieces 13inches long.<br />Not one 13 inches long.  Can I return it.\\nI was so excited to get this from my daughter and I would echo the other review that said it smelled awful<br />When it arrived. It smelled like old paint and frankly I am afraid of giving it to my daughter as she may put it in her mouth. Also the pieces didn\\'t match the picture. It said it had 10 pieces but what I recieved only had 6.\\n\"The most terrible product ever.  I bought it, opened it- attempted to insert the valve and it was completely sealed shut so I had to gently poke a hole (twenty minute process) while avoiding popping the material. Once I accomplished that (FINALLY!) I had to find an air pump to try and hold the nozzle to because they make sure to make the nozzle as awkward as possible to try and force you into buying their s***ty air pump and blow it up. Blew it up half way and let my two year old play with it on CARPET and flat linoleum flooring with absolutely nothing sharp around and within 30 minutes it exploded on her. RIDICULOUS...\"\\n\"one router won\\'t spin, so haven\\'t been able to fly it yet\"\\nDirections are in Chinese.

I\\'m 135 lbs. Poor quality!\\n\"This is a bad product that doesn\\'t work and simply false advertisement.  My kids were excited out of the box, but first thing first.  The colors don\\'t match at all.  &#34;Blue&#34; is white powders, &#34;Yellow&#34; is orange colors, etc.  So I figure maybe it glows into those colors.  Wrong!  It does NOT glow at all.  What a waste of money and this is blatantly false advertisement.  I am very surprise Crayola does this.  I\\'ve always considered Crayola to be an honest and fair company, but I guess I was wrong.\"\\n\"The box is warped so the sides don\\'t meet the bottom.  It\\'s supposed to be held together with tiny tacks, but the sides and bottom don\\'t meet securely, so if I put the sand in it, it will leak out.  I will glue and clamp it and see if that works, because I don\\'t have time to hassle with returning it for a replacement, and from the looks of the cheap construction, I\\'m not convinced another one would arrive any better.  Once I fix it, it looks like it\\'ll be fine, but I didn\\'t buy this planning to finish the assembly myself.  Very poor quality box.\"\\nI bout this booster box a seconed time and boosters were all ready opened some only had three cards most had four looked like someone raided it for the expensive cards. i spent 88.00 and paid for one day shipping for a brand new box not someones leftovers. i have 100 and was soppose to get 150 30 boosters 5 in each you do the math so upset id take a picture but i doubt it would help my case\\nI\\'m returning this wig because it didn\\'t fit our average size 4 year old. It was far too small!\\n\"Thin cheap plastic and no on/off switch. It runs constantly unless you unplug the 9-volt battery (not included). Be careful with the battery cover. It is so thin, it can snap in two in your fingers.

Don\\'t risk making the kids cry when they get them and then they don\\'t work.\"\\n\"Cute, but will not stay inflated :/\"\\nThe nets aren\\'t deep enough and the ball just pops out.

The visor has snaps in the front to open and close but I\\'m not sure why. As long as the visor goes up and down, do you really have to secure it in place when it is down?! One of the snaps is really hard to close and the plastic on the side is bent and sticks out. The visor in the front on the bottom is not clean cut across but ragged and it looks like somebody ripped it across. The strap underneath is way too long and is the kind that you have to weave through the metal. Not kid friendly at all! The foam inside the helmet looks like it was just stuck in there any which way.<br />I know it was only $7 but I did expect more. I can\\'t put this thing on my kid\\'s head. My son is autistic and I already know that besides all the other issues, the helmet is too narrow for him, hugging his head entirely, no space around the ears. This was supposed to be a birthday present so I can\\'t have him try it on but I know my son and I know this helmet would freak him out. It\\'s like putting a plastic bag over your kid\\'s head.<br />I will spend a little more and get a nice round helmet! Do not buy this thing!\"\\nSent the set back.

I have a nice collection of Lego Architecture models, which I have displayed in my studio, and I love them all. This model however, does not fit in with the other models both in terms of scale and design interpretation. The model is clunky and out of proportion and does not express the timeless elegance of the original building. I has the appearance of a heavy and awkward monolith. I ended up returning it, which thanks to Amazon, I was able to do. Regarding the quality of the product: it is perfect like all Lego products.

Waste of money!\"\\nBroke within the first hour and the box was smashed when I recieved it.\\nThe size of this toy is not worth the $30.00 price tag.  It is roughly the size (length) of a dollar bill.  I was expecting something different.  I returned it immediately.\\nThey were much smaller than was indicated.\\nIt quit working after 2 weeks.  I\\'ve made sure the batteries worked and everything.\\n\"For the price I was not expecting much.  But, I did expect it to work; and, was disappointed when the lights did not turn on.  Plus, the tiara is sized too small for an adult.  But, it did fit my 2 year old yellow lab.  So, for the party, I wore flowers in my hair and the dog wore the tiara.\"\\nThe item was not working properly mainly because the air was escaping from the sides of the base. We fixed it somewhat by gluing around the edges. Not worth the money.\\n\"The plexiglass came scratched and not really suitable for display. The holes were stripped, preventing the two sides from being bound together and as a result the cards slipped out.\"\\nNot a good value.  Balloons are very thin and burst easily.\\nFor 3 dollars what should one expect. Does not work. The seller was good about offering half refund. I just think this product should stay in the country that manufactures it. The picture is better looking than the Quality of the product.\\nCheap cheap. The straps broke with in 45 minutes of having it. Cheaply made for the cost was very disapointed. Also it is small like toddler size not for a big kid.\\nToo thick to hold any cards .\\n\"This sheds all over, seems cheaply made.

Would not buy again for fear it would be missing a piece.\\nmaterial was so fragile that merely handling it resulted in perforations.\\n\"I am very disturbed by the message this game sends with the horrible picture on the front of the box.  I foster and provide rescue transport to animals who have suffered abuse at the hands of idiots.

It didn\\'t fly right.  It would lose connection at about 10 ft. It would fall like a stone, then one motor would run full speed on he ground.  Had to turn off both copter and controller every time.

I figured I get some lame ones or just bad in general, so I ordered 4 packs expecting them to be somewhat random. Unfortunately, none of the stickers I got were shown here and really none are cool. Pretty big let down not getting even one sticker I wanted out of 400. Also it was kinda weird receiving kid stickers in a set labeled &#34;Skateboard Snowboard Vintage&#34;.

I thought it would be the same size as Spot It but it is about a third of that size. SUPER tiny. AND it only has a third of the original cards, which is frustrating because there is totally room in the can for a whole set of cards. It makes the game go really fast (like 2 minutes fast) and is not near as fun. Super sad we bought this instead of the real game.\"\\nThe rear hand strap came cut on arrival.\\nBatteries were dead when we received this.\\nToo small\\nSave your money.

Not happy with the purchase at all.\\nThe item did not function when we tried to use it the first time. The motor did not run & the remote control did not work on the left side.

This product was also purchased by our daughter who had the same problem.  Needless to say, this pool float is a bust was a waste of money.\"\\nOverpriced!\\nBroke the motor in like I was supposed. Never even got to go full speed or really drive it and the piston rod broke. Neat looking car tho\\n\"[[VIDEOID:8624daff697ac2841c8520d4627f6a23]]NOTE to the Zillionz - the making this:   You created a wonderful toy, I mean this is really awesome, but please test it before you release it to the market.    ----  I am reducing this from 5* to 1* review.    My daughter just loved this toy, I mean she really love it so that she could hide things from her brothers.   It got shattered.    When things were good - I have attached a video of how it used to work.  Now, it has stopped recognizing my daughter\\'s voice.   If i have to make it work again, I have to reset the password.   Frustrating actually and feel bad for my daughter who has fallen in love with this toy.      --- My previous 5 * review  (1) Set a password - in your voice with a word/phrase  (2) Press a button on the safe which says \\'voice lock\\'  (3) Speak your password and the safe opens    -- If the password is incorrect, in the 3rd attempt, it will sound an real life sounding alarm.  -- If you forget the password, you can open the battery compartment and press the reset button    Note:  this is just a toy, not a real safe\"\\nI was so disappointed with the dolphin.  It was too small to cuddle with and really wasn\\'t what I thought it would be\\nThe package had been opened and they restapled it and taped it up so when i tried to pull all the items out the stickers where stuck to the tape and ripped! One of kaleidoscopes its missing the end piece that makes it the kaleidoscope! Very disappointed! No where did it say that it was a opened package they taped up to resale!\\n\"The magnet is not even and some of the letters don\\'t even stay on the fridge.  I would not recommend these, but they are cute! My daughter likes to throw them at my animals.\"\\n\"This thing is a joke. It\\'s much smaller than it looks online,about the size of a toy basketball, but I figured that maybe that didn\\'t affect how well it worked. I put in the disc that\\'s supposed to look like stars and it\\'s just a small patch of blurry specs of light. This would have been a rip off if it cost $20, but at $100?! Freaking robbery. Returning immediately.\"\\nThis set did not work for us. We tried all different sand consistency and each time it just crumbled. It\\'s a pain to put together. Very frustrating for the kids.\\nI cannot believe how I received this item. I was in complete shock. It was half opened(the top wasn\\'t all the way on) and the tube is sticky! It looks like it is about five years old and the actual item doesn\\'t even work!!!! I spent almost $10 on somebody\\'s thrown out garbage!!! I have never had anything like this happened to me before on Amazon! The pictures are not that good(sorry) It doesn\\'t show the true nature of how bad this actually was. It\\'s crazy because everybody else is giving a great reviews. I wonder what went wrong. I marked the category &#34;new&#34;. Very very upset. BE CAREFUL.\\n\"I got what I deserve for shopping on Amazon. What I received is clearly not an official Cards Against Humanity expansion pack. Not only do the cards not match my official, original game, but the six expansion packs don\\'t match each other in thickness or color. One pack isn\\'t even solid black, but instead has a houndstooth pattern printed on the back of the cards. Its nice to have new cards, but had I known they would be so different I would have bought them from CAH. Be aware...\"\\n\"Ive never gotten this, but ive seen it run. I do not recommend buying this item. The design and how it works is bad.

I guess the only reason to rate it one star is the fact that it\\'s in good condition.\\n\"smells, very light weight\"\\n\"This is an awful toy. It had great reviews so I bought it, but the noise it makes every time you move it back and forth is enough to drive me to the loony bin. I took it away after 2 days and it\\'s been sitting in the closet for months.\"\\nThis was the most ridiculous purchase ever. $20 for a bag of 29 Legos? Deceitful and I will be returning.\\n\"Bought these skates for my 5 year old son for his birthday.  They are made much smaller than what is stated. He wore them TWICE for less than an hour and the plastic buckle/latch tore through where the metal pin is on the latch so it no longer buckles. I ordered early and put them away until his birthday arrived... so now when I went to replace the item, I am 20 days too late and out $25.00. I am very disappointed.\"\\n\"This Ready-To-Fly rocket came with the shaft glued onto the base crooked by the manufacturer. We went through a couple failed launches where it curved right down to the ground and expended the rest of the engine fuel. Unfortunately we didn\\'t have another rocket handy, so we had to cut the event short. We have requested a replacement and if it flies well we will update the review.\"\\nLED goes out with gentle tap/bump of baton.\\nDo not buy; I purchased to learn before buying a Phantom 3 Professional. Don\\'t waste your money. First day...crapped out!  I\\'m returning!  You get what you pay for!\\n\"Bought this at a different store but wanted to leave a review to keep others from purchasing. Not only did our marble run come in a brand new box with three pieces completely missing, but a few of the pieces were malformed and did not fit. My kids marbles did not fit and the ones that came with the set were too light to fall through the maze. Although cheap, I still believe the product should at least function. Do. Not. Buy. Total and complete waste of money.\"\\n\"I agree with those who say that nothing sticks to these -- pencil, ball point pen, paint -- except permanent marker.  Too bad.  Good idea.  But.\"\\n\"I purchased this costume jewelry necklace and knew it would not be &#34;top of the line&#34; jewelry because of the price. I loved the multi-colors. But, I never expected the necklace to be a kit! It came in 7 pieces when I took it out of the clear cellophane package. I had jeweler pliers so putting it together was not a real issue for me. I really don\\'t think anyone should have to assemble a necklace purchased. However, the colors are very pretty.\"\\nItem pictured is genuine lego but the figure they are selling is a chinese knockoff fake. Buyer beware do not buy. This is NOT lego\\nIt was perf ect. Thanks for quick service.\\nMy son thought it was big but when it came it\\'s so tiny so 25$ for a little thing\\nJust purchase this quad copter in July 2015 was flying pretty good all of a sudden it just took off on me disappointing. I also order motors for it  a case for it and batteries now it\\'s gone. WOW! Don\\'t buy it from Formula Toys i\\'m shopping elsewhere.\\n\"It just arrived and it does NOT work! I put in new batteries thinking they may be old, but NOTHING!! I would never order from this company again.\"\\nThis was useless.  Did not have power enough to pick up a small kernel of popcorn on my desk.  VERY disappointed in this item.\\n\"The &#34;variety&#34; of the colors that were shipped were horrid, and they were not true bright colors, they were faded and off colors. Caution when purchasing these.

The pictures misleading\\nTerrible purchase!  One car worked sporadically with both remotes. The other car would not work at all. We charged batteries where possible and replaced the others but no luck. My grandsons were so disappointed with their birthday presents. I will be in touch with Kidzlane to return for repair or replacement.  I might even st my payment once I learn KidLane\\'s desponse. Very disappointed.\\nThese aren\\'t worth 40 😂\\n\"This is an absolute piece of junk. I bought this for my daughter\\'s birthday.  I assembled it and none of the lights work. The motor is very, very weak. We just had to place an order for a similar electric Range Rover on Amazon, but made by a different company to make sure we get this before her birthday. Buyer beware. I am not looking forward to having to disassemble this, cram it back in the box and return it to the vendor.\"\\n\"Ok...so I don\\'t &#34;hate&#34; it, but this product is poorly made. My son LOVES this toy and it fell and shattered (our fault) and I replaced it. Both times the wind button broke the FIRST day we got it. I took the second one out of the box and pushed the wind button and it broke. I was not (and still am not) happy with the poor quality of this item. I only kept it because my son did not want me to return it. The manufacturer needs to fix this. Given the opportunity to purchase this again, or as a gift, I would NOT buy it. Fix the buttons so they don\\'t easily break and I might reconsider. Buyer beware...look around for another one.\"\\n\"Hard puzzle, very small pieces.\"\\n2 of them leaked the 2nd week I had them\\nCheap and flimsy\\n\"not what I thought for small children, but made a nice patio light\"\\nNot worth 73 dollars.

The arm that launches the boulder, the boulder barely goes anywhere! The same arm is weakly attached to the body.\"\\nMy daughter couldn\\'t wait to wear her new costume for dress up day at camp. It was quite disappointing that the wings literally fell apart before the bus arrived. She had them on for 10 minutes when the wings began to fray and the elastic snapped.\\n\"Used a few times indoors, broke in less than two weeks. Came apart at the seams.\"\\n\"No description. I thought this would be a 4x2 binder, but it\\'s 2x2. No internal pictures to see pages. Black looks Brown. Spend extra money and get the bigger one...\"\\n\"Absolute mess!  I spent 30 minutes cleaning this crap off my windows.  Multiple rinses with a rag (that I had to throw away) with water and then had to finish with Windex to get the film off.  If any of the crayon touches the floor, it will be tracked through your whole house.  These are awful.  Do not buy.\"\\nNot happy with this product at all. My kids have played in the tent a total of 3 times bc it\\'s not sturdy at all it just falls right on them. The wiring is already coming out bc of the Very poor quality. It came with some tools that I assumed were to anchor them into the ground they were completely pointless. I plan to buy them this caterpillar tunnel that stays up by itself.\\n\"MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDSON WAS SO EXCITED WAITING FOR THIS BACKPACK WHICH MEASUREMENTS SHOWED HEIGHT 35. THERE WAS NO MENTION MADE THAT THIS WAS NOT INCHES.  THE BACKPACK MEASURES A HEIGHT OF 13 1/2&#34;.  IT IS TINY AND WOULD BE A GOOD SIZE FOR A PRE SCHOOL CHILD.  FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BY AMAZON.

The plates were very cute. The napkins and plasticware did not match at all. The cups leaked everywhere. We had juice and milk all over the countertop even after we doubled them. Had to throw them away.\\nDo not buy this\\n\"This was the biggest waste of money I have spent on Amazon.  I bought it as a birthday gift and kept it wrapped for a few weeks.  When the birthday party came, we opened it up and connected it to the hose.  Water sprayed everywhere - except out the tentacles.  There was no seal anywhere on this item.  The connection leaked, the entire bottom panel leaked, each tentacle leaked at the connection.  It was very disappointing to the children who were excited to use it.  And because I waited to give it as a gift, the time to return it has passed.  I am very disappointed and will avoid Banzai toys in the future.\"\\nI didn\\'t realize 3.0 meant 3 inches.  It\\'s SO tiny a baby could wear it.\\n\"Bought four decks under the impression that there were going to be little to no duplications and in mint - excellent condition.. Not what happened.. Every deck I opened included almost all total repeats of the deck before.. I don\\'t enjoy getting 4 decks that are almost identical..

Listing says no commons but I received several.. Item received is no where near what was described..\"\\nDid not work.\\nMy big three year old could not squeeze this. It also broke the first week we had this. I bought the Ettore Grip n Grab and my son loves it. Easy to grip and more durable.\\nSuper disappointed in this balloon I bought for my nephew\\'s Looney Tunes birthday party! The balloon was filled multiple times with helium and would not float. It would deflate in minutes! It didn\\'t appear to have any holes either.\\nThis is a birthday gift.  I was disappointed with the appearance of the box.  It was apparently a returned product because the item was re-taped together. It looks awful.  The box was slightly smashed and taped together.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.  It does not look like a new item.  It certainly did not meet my expectations.  I am currently unable to review the item itself as I haven\\'t given the gift yet to my grandson yet.\\n\"My 10 year old son purchased this item and thought it was a set of seven, which it is NOT!!

This package blew up just fine, but after only a few minutes, they all completely deflated, while the balloons bought from Party City were just fine.  In the pic, you can see the green balloons with black ties all deflated.  Sending back for a refund.\"\\nI felt a bit deceived by the &#34;Shopkin&#34; brand name being heavily associated with the product.

Once it was set up, it requires very cold and very hot water to make the color changes.  Of course, that means you constantly have to recharge it with hot or cold water, which was a pain.  The whole thing is really a gimick, with no real useable track, which acts as a car shower.  Really, you could just buy one of the color shifter cars and then toss hot and cold water on them.  But, that would be possible if the color shifter cars were not abysmal too.  The color shifter car, after changing colors a few times, decided it would just remain the same color with barely any changes, regardless how hot or cold the water is.<br /><br />On the whole, save your money.  This kit is awful.\"\\nThese are pretty bad. You can see through them and they feel like the plastic will tear super easy. I love this style of bags but these are the worst I have ever bought.

I was in the clear. My pull out game weak af and I thought this would help me out.... I was wrong. She called me up this morning saying She\\'s pregnant. I had the card in my hand and tried to use it to go to a different dimension. It took me to a different one alright. The dimension is called &#34;Fatherhood&#34;.\\n\"We couldn\\'t even bear to finish making the product after seeing the slimy, soggy, wet noodles it created. Just gross. I wish I had taken a photo!<br /><br /> Even my daring 8 year old wouldn\\'t touch it. She was also disappointed that there was no cooking involved. I don\\'t know how clear the commercials were about the fact that you don\\'t cook this, but my daughter was disappointed.\"\\n\"Cheapest plastic.

Well, I got something else instead.\"\\nSo flimsy and cheap that it bends and wrinkles under its own weight. Should be a 2 dollar item. Junk!\\nVery disappointed.  The little tiles are so tiny as to not be useable. Pieces are about 1/2 in by 1/4 inch and paper thin.\\n\"I\\'ve owned several drones and RC helicopters over the months, mainly cheaper ones or clone makers. I bought this because I thought Blade was a top brand. Not so, I feel the clones are constructed better. The body wasn\\'t even hard plastic. Actually, for the money, I was expecting an alloy. But it was like a think sheet plastic, not anywhere near solid. After 1 day, it\\'s coming apart. Also, the blades will break anytime it touches something. I had to order 6 extra main blades. Also, the dual main blades are supposed to be more stable and easier to fly. Not on this model anyways. It sucks. Very difficult to control - my clone single rotor is much easier to fly. Biggest waste of money.\"\\nLasted only about 2 times before it died.  Batteries corroded and weren\\'t fixable.  On/off switches didn\\'t work after second time out.  Was fun the two times it worked.\\nDo not purchase this!  Save yourself and your child the frustration.  It worked for one day then the bottom arm broke fitting crumpled and now the arm will not stay in the slot.  It is very cheaply made.  It did not stand up to light use by my 8 year old who was sick at the time.  We were very disappointed in this toy from Nerf.\\nThe battery leaked and the camera spoils.\\nDidn\\'t take long before this stopped working!

In my opinion, not a kid friendly toy.\"\\n\"I bought this at the beginning of summer and Fabric has already started to fade and summer is not over yet.

That was disappointing but I was still excited to finally get my hands on these special touchable bubbles. They were a surprise for some kids on vacation. I was even more disappointed to find out that they were not touchable bubbles. Just standard bubbles that I paid WAY to much for. The picture attached shows 3 vials that I never opened.

The area that the connector strap attaches to the tubes weakened and began to leak. Avoid this model and order one of the older versions.\\nTotal waste of money. We filled them up and the water slowly leaked out of every one of them before they were able to be thrown.

The package of coins was full... there were at least 20.  We put the batteries in and the kids started playing.  It worked well for about five minutes and then the claw would open when it would close and vice versa.  We followed the troubleshooting tips and couldn\\'t correct the problem.  There was no information to contact customer service or a web address for more help anywhere in the instructions.  This thing is also super loud!

They had every detail with Tiffany\\'s lipstick, a little necklace that said chucky, and her wedding gown and colored finger nail polish.

Shame.\\nItem was not DJI.\\n\"I think it would have to be a very focused 6-year-old to successfully assemble this kit; maybe a patient 10-year-old would be more like it. On the other hand a 4-year-old might absorb some of the basic physics/mechanical lessons from the finished product. I\\'m not sure why they made the thing so complex when it seems to only go together one way anyhow. Patience is a virtue, I guess, but are we teaching kids about physics or teaching them how NOT to design a machine? The real Rube Goldberg aspect of this thing is not in the rolling marbles and meshing gears but in the stationary structural parts of it, in that they concocted a roundabout and inefficient way of accomplishing a simple task.  Well most of the parts seem to be neither super fragile nor extremely sturdy, except I did wish the whole auger had been made in one solid piece. The biggest problem we have had after assembly is that the first gear (with the crank attached) keeps popping off its pivot pin constantly. This alone makes the toy seem like a piece of garbage. Another thing I dislike is the funnel part... it looks like the balls should spin down into smaller, faster orbits as they approach the center hole, but instead they make a few orbits around the outside edge then lose momentum and roll almost directly into the hole.  I like the gears and the auger and the rolling marbles in principle, but I do not like how they went out of their way to make the construction complex when it could have been simple and functional.\"\\nDeflated in 2 days.\\n\"This wallet is PAPER. The description says, Tyvek is Paper Thin Yet Super Strong and Waterproof. Well, not only is it paper thin, but it is PAPER. I bought this for my 7 year old grandson, a Seahawks fan.

With the rise of quads and other RC models such as tanks and tractors this radio is outdated and so is the company. Interoperability and flexibility is important and this radio does not have any of that.<br /><br />I am highly disappointed in this radio. This radio is for flying airplanes only. If you want to do anything other than planes or perhaps helicopters (not quads) I would spend the money almost anywhere else. I bought this radio thinking it would be a good all in one solution for me to control my boats, quads and RC construction equipment. I was wrong, This is a terrible radio for anything other than planes.<br /><br />The Screen: First lets start with the screen you have two options, planes or helicopters. Nothing more. No choice for quads, or other vehicles. This means I always have to look at a picture of a plane on the screen when I\\'m sailing or driving a tractor. I know its just a picture but it annoys me so much. Not everyone fly\\'s planes. The screen also has no back light at all, my $15 Timex has a back light, and its waterproof. Why does a $300 radio not have a back light?<br /><br />The controls: This is a 7 channel radio. 4 channels are used with the sticks, that leaves 3 channels. Plenty for most models, however the layout and switches make the last 3 channels almost unusable for anything but airplanes. The layout of the switches is terrible and the switches are labeled, not by channel number but by what function they do on an airplane model. (gear, flaps). Of the three remaining channels is a knob, one is a three way switch, and one is a 2 way switch. Again this layout of controls is not helpful for anything other than planes.<br /><br />The sticks: Not many complaints here except the internal parts are very weak. One of the first things I did is adjust the springs inside so both sticks are self centering (for dual prop boats and quad flight) and byslightly over tightening one of the screws I cracked the plastic holding the centering spring. I admit this was my fault for over tightening, but this is an adjustment customers are suppose to make and anyone could do this. Spektrum needs to strengthen the plastic or put a stop behind the adjustment screw. This however did not effect the operation of the stick so I just left it cracked.<br /><br />Firmware: This is where the Airplane focus is very clear. All the settings are based around adjusting for airplane flight. The channels are labeled exclusively for airplanes and are called “Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder, Gear, Aux 1 and Aux 2.” What if I sail boats or fly quads? Why not label them channel 1-7?<br /><br />This transmitter has 7 switches, and only 2 of them control channels (the third channel is a knob). What do the other 5 switches do? I\\'m sure if I flew airplanes I would know, but I don\\'t. I could think of many uses for these switches, but the software is only for airplanes and allows no customization of the controller or switches at all. Why can\\'t I swap channels around the different switches, or program what the switches do?<br /><br />Here is one example of what could be done if the software was different: Lets say I wanted to drive an RC backhoe. I want to drive the wheels and steering with the main sticks sometimes, then throw one of the 5 extra switches and now the sticks become the control for the backhoe bucket using the three extra channels. This is not something I can do with this controller or the built in the software. Its impossible with this controller even though it\\'s as simple as better firmware<br /><br />The menus don\\'t follow any kind of intuitive design. There are two menu\\'s. One menu is accessed with the scroll wheel. This menu makes sense and is easy to use. There is also another hidden menu you get at by pressing the clear and back buttons at the same time. Why hide menus like that? Why should switching models require thesecret code of pressing two buttons, but the servo setup and range test is under the normal menu? Who thought this was a good idea? Why is the software not open source? Is your bad programing such a secret you don’t want me making it better?<br /><br />This transmitter will only store 20 models. Why? Is memory so expensive you can\\'t afford to store a few more? The radio has an SD card but I don\\'t know what its used for other than backup and firmware upgrades (that never happen). An SD card will NOT expand the number of models you can store. I think its possible to work around this problem with backing up the models to the SD card and then restoring from another card but come on? 20? really? I could do better with an arduio.<br /><br />Receivers: The receivers are only for airplanes. They are labeled, not by channel number but by function such as elevator or aileron. I really enjoy how not all Spektrum receivers will work with this radio. The waterproof receivers for cars and boats don\\'t work with this transmitter. You can only use the non-waterproof airplane receivers. Why? Why cant I use a 2 channel waterproof receiver in my sailboat with this transmitter?<br /><br />I\\'m very disappointed with the cost and lack of flexibility of this radio. I would spend my money elsewhere. I can buy 3 transmitters that have nine channels and open source software for the cost this one 7 channel radio. Don\\'t buy this radio if you do anything other than RC planes.\"\\n\"Uggghhhh these things.  Yes, they\\'re cute.  Yes, they\\'re trendy....and it ends there.  These are a ripoff of the worst sort.  How do you justify $35 for something you make once (and it only takes 5 minutes to make all the globes)....then what do you do with this set?  It\\'s flimsy, topples, and is too small to use with imaginative play.  Her princess dolls are far larger than this castle.  It looks pretty, but she can\\'t play with it.  Don\\'t get sucked into this money trap.\"\\nThe part that connects to the belt broke after two weeks.\\nOnly good for use with toddlers. The first time I used it only toddlers used it and there were no breaks. I am an adult and tried it out the next time. I put a hole in it! ( it was fun tho!!!)  So I patched it up and three 8-year-olds used it today. Completely busted!\\n\"Terrible Product!  They are horrible, cheap and produce nothing but static. Only 2 buttons work. The rest are decoration only.  You cannot change channels or do anything but listen to static. Amazon should remove this from their inventory completely. The only thing I can say positively is that it\\'s a cheap enough product that I didn\\'t return, I just tossed in the trash.\"\\n\"If animal abuse is a game then this world is in bad shape.  The manufacturer of this game needs to take a good hard look at the cover, realize this is NOT acceptable.\"\\nVery disappointed.  We bought two.  Both malfunction after only 3 times used.\\n\"I purchased this for my birthday and being relatively new at collecting I fell victim to a fake item. Funny thing is I find out months later when I had my collection valued only to find to my disgust this was a fake. Had I known immediately I would\\'ve returned that minute, I\\'m more upset for the fact that it came without warning. Would not recommend buying and if you\\'re already a victim beware of the fake &#34;Official Nintendo&#34; decal once it was brought to my attention the evidence was clear.\"\\nVery small and doesnt spin around as it is supposed to. I would say it is for a 1-2 yr old baby but not much fun for older kids.

The outfit was way bigger then 0-3 looks like it could fit a 5 year old the size does not reflect the actual size I ordered.\\nThese are very flimsy and the tapped holes in the metal joints were already stripped when I got them. It does not hold together and I had to throw the whole thing out after one landing.\\nWay littler than what I expected. Definitely not what they said they retail for these our like the 7.99 one in the store not close to the price they said they were supported to be. Was going to give them as a birthday gift but won\\'t know that I know they are the 7.99 in the toys store.\\n\"It\\'s very disappointing to order a product with glowing reviews that turns out to be an ordinary plebeian thing. The reviews highlighted for this product are obviously false. Though the picture looks large, the diameter isn\\'t referenced and it\\'s smaller than a tennis ball, slightly larger than a golf ball. It bounces with less energy than an ordinary superball, available for less than half the price (and with twice the resiliency.) It\\'s not going to attract friends, nor help you entertain your kids in a parking lot. My purchasing it wasn\\'t the end of the world, I just wish they would filter the misleading reviews and publish the size in the specs.\"\\n\"came as Cleveland Browns, not Cincinnati Bengals as pictured - gave it away - very disappointed\"\\nPoor quality for $$\\nGot the wrong item twice!

Cheaply made and not containing all pieces expected.  Returned immediately!!\\n\"Very thin plastic, only lasted 3 hours in a fairly empty pool\"\\n\"This is not the game I remember as a child. They removed too much like playing the stock market, buying insurance, betting on the wheel, etc. The new version is just a boring board game where you spin and win large sums of money.

My son loves motorcycles, and all toys that make noises--this does both! To take it out of the packaging, it required scissors to remove the three plastic straps holding it in. As soon as it was taken out of the packaging, the motorcycle fell off. I looked through the packaging for some sort of guide/instructions to see how to use it, but our toy did not have any inside the packaging. I was able to force the motorcycle back into place, after some playing around. I then tried using it, before my son did, and I was absolutely stumped. I would gently hold the sides of the tire so that the red tread could rotate freely, but this toy wouldn\\'t move more than an inch on carpet. I then tried it on our kitchen floor (linoleum), but again, it rolled two inches before it would tip over, and make the whirr-noise. I had (much) younger siblings, parents, other children, etc all attempt to use this toy, and no one was able to succeed with making it move more than a couple inches before toppling over. If we received this as a gift, I would end up tossing it in the garbage as I\\'d be too embarrassed to ask for a gift receipt to make an exchange. My son now just plays with the motorcycle and leaves the wheel in his toy room.<br /><br />FYI: I received this toy via a sampling program through power reviews.\"\\nThese are cheap Chinese knock-offs of actual LEGO products.

I wasn\\'t expecting a lavish dress but I also wasn\\'t expecting a paper thin costume either.  I bought it for my daughter to give to her at Disney, she saw it so now I can not return it:(\"\\n\"Updated January 2016: This product broke after what I would consider normal use for a child\\'s toy (my 4 year old put it in a backpack which he carried around the house for 10 minutes; tablet came out with its screen cracked).  VTech customer support told me that the warranty was void due to misuse of the device.  I was then told I could purchase a new one on their website.  This is the second VTech toy that my son has broken in less than 6 months use with no help at all from their customer support or &#34;warranty&#34;.  --Original Review-- Bought this as a replacement for a cheap Android tablet.  I was hoping for a more open app experience, perhaps with access to Google Play or Amazon\\'s appstore.  Unfortunately, this tablet is locked down to VTech\\'s store which has very limited options for &#34;approved&#34; apps, unless they were made by VTech or Disney.  There are plenty of &#34;branded&#34; games, which at least seem to all be educational, even if the branding doesn\\'t always make sense.  The real disappointment for me, however, was the amount of advertising built into the unit.  The tablet came with a sample cartridge... of movie ads for games not included.  The tablet also came pre-loaded with more movie ads stored on the harddrive, which I have yet to figure out how to delete.  There is also a beanstalk game to indoctrinate my child with the more sleazier practices of app development, like real-time delay timers (take a look at Tiny Tower on the appstore if you don\\'t know what I mean).  That said, the product functions, the headphones worked (for about 12 hours before my child broke them, YMMV), and there are some decent educational apps.  I also like being able to load my own mp3s on the tablet and I was able to convert some of my movies to the required MP4 format for the Innotab to be able to play them.  Note that the Innotab will not play WMV files or AVI files.\"\\nVery flimsy\\nThe lines become tangle up inside the reel cover and are difficult to correct.\\nVery poor quality. Don\\'t waste the money buying these.\\n\"missing parts, no instructions! don\\'t buy\"\\n\"We ordered two boxes of these balloons (totaling 240) and we only got around 30 functioning balloons. Yes, we followed the directions exactly. Unfortunately, the ones that were &#34;functioning&#34; had to be thrown so hard that the kids couldn\\'t even pop then. I got hit in the back of the neck with one and it just hurt because it didn\\'t pop. And it was thrown from the top of a water slide! We had a clown show up at the party and she had a cooler full of water balloons (not this brand) so I will be using whatever she used next time.\"\\n\"As with other reviews, it was a lot of fun until it started to split along the seams after 3 weeks, and now it\\'s completely useless.\"\\nSo when I turned this drone on and plugged Linked the remote and plugged the piece the baterie turned very red and started smoking so I turned it off quickly and it was blazing hot so then I did it again and it worked but when I would try to fly it up it was flipping and kept falling very bad drone\\nDont buy this ones.. are for old rc with no hex.. crap\\n\"Too small in my opinion., but they worked out\"\\n\"It would not hold air, the head had two holes which I patched, not sure what going on with the bottom part, but it would not inflate well enough to stay afloat in the water, it tips over making it unusable. could not send back because by the time I went use it my receipt had been thrown away.\"\\nHorrible blaster\\nI know it says that &#34;colors may vary&#34; but I thought there would be at least SOME color.  Every bottle was white... Not cool for my 4-year-old\\'s birthday party.\\nMold builds up inside and you cant take it apart unless you drill some holes.  Love their toys but this one miss the mark.  Get the ferry boat instead. It comes apart for easy cleaning\\nDidn\\'t like the quality of the product.\\nBroke within 15 mins. Did everything the directions said to make sure we use it correctly and it still stopped working.\\n\"Winter may be coming but so is a Pint Glass with scratched adhesives and crooked placement. I\\'m very disappointed.<br />The glass came nicely wrapped but, upon opening, I noticed the Stark logo was scratched.  I thought to myself, already? The reviews of this product haven\\'t been too kind,  It got worse.  I thought I could live with the scratch and I poured myself a glass of water. My office colleague came by and quickly noticed that the &#34;winter is coming&#34; adhesive was crooked.  Sloppy.  The Starks and purchasers of this produce deserve better.<br />Winter is coming but this glass is going back.\"\\n\"The very first time we used it, the seam split when we were half-way down the river.  It was a calm river too.  The single person tubes worked quite well.  I would not recommend the double tube.  Also, the built in cooler does not keep anything cold.  The ice melts within an hour.\"\\n\"These toys are so poorly built! Within a few hours several were already broken. Pieces coming off of the tops, screws coming out of moving parts and wheels coming off. And this was just my 4 year old playing very quietly at the table with them. I contacted the company who apologized and promised to send a new set to replace the broken ones. We received a package a few weeks later with only 2 replacements (when I originally contacted them more than that were already broken and discussed). They have since also broken. My son loves them, even broken, or I\\'d just send them back. That is a lot of money for junky toys. So disappointed.\"\\n\"This would be a great item if they would just send it to me, like they said they would in June. It is now Aug grrrr\"\\nwas very few pieces for the cost. very disappointed and sent it back\\nWe were looking forward to playing this game when it arrived.  We planned an Minion evening with movies. The game buzzer is broken and only the nose lite up.  The fun part of the game is the buzzer gong off.  The shipping box was already thrown out so now I am stuck with a broken game.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.\\nDid not work and deflated completely after 1 hour.\\nFound 6 pieces of wood broken and no directions with kit\\n\"This only gets a star because I can\\'t give it a zero.

Whaaa...Now I have to buy other 12 pack of Supertips for my child to get a black marker. The art teacher is ALWAYS saying &#34;Take out your black marker&#34; I\\'m told. Come on Crayola, there should have been 2 black markers!!!\"\\n\"I bought this for my grandchildren, and it\\'s a silly game, which games should be but they did not like it.  we played it several times but there was very little interest in it.  grandkids are 7 and 9.  they really like the Spot It games much better.\"\\n\"While the Barbie itself was just fine, the windsurfer board was not.  The slots where the doll’s feet were to attach were too big so that the doll would not stand up on it.  For all that I spent on the set, I should have just bought a $5.00 Barbie in the bathing suite and called it a day.  My granddaughter was not at all happy that she got a doll and surfboard to take to the beach to play with …. and all she got was one more Barbie to add to her collection.  What I ultimately got with this purchase was a waste of my money and a very disappointed little girl.\"\\n\"Wife bought this for our son with the idea of protection it from some of his fits/accidental drops. There are two things wrong with this:<br /><br />1. Zero front side protection. So never drop it on it\\'s face.<br /><br />2. The right and left bumpers are not only not protected, the case will BREAK you bumpers if the device is dropped. The design of the case is poor, if dropped the 2DS will come out or will shift enough to catch on the bottom of the bumpers. This will cause the bumper to receive all of the force of the fall and pop out the base of the button from the main case. If your child tries to use it this way, the plastic that holds the bumper in place is thin and will be damaged if attempted to be used after being dislodged. You have to take the entire back off, not just the battery compartment, and re-seat the bumper and spring.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants to protect their device. I discovered issue #1 upon opening the package and issue #2 after my son dropped it a few times and the bumpers kept popping out for some reason.\"\\nIt says MADE IN CHINA in big red letters...so tacky!\\n\"Poorly engineered, terrible quality. Parts are falling off, antenna broke off the first day.

REAL NICE.\\nThe Green Lantern Child\\'s Hal Jordan Costume looks exactly like the online photo.

The characters faces looked awful.\\nIt broke five minutes after my son opened the package.\\n\"I bought one as a backup in fall and it sat in the basement all winter. First hot weather, we got it out and the lower baffle did not stay inflated even 24 hours, so I chalked it up to loss and bought a second one. The air valves on these pools are incredibly difficult to seat. The seal for the larger air hole sits in a groove like an 0-ring, and the first few times you do it, it\\'s worth your life to get it to seat properly. The valve is intricate - has a smaller opening in the center of it that makes the whole thing ungainly and, I would think, apt to leak just on its own. Gradually the o-ring fitting loosens up, but it\\'s a fight. Went a week with daily refilling of it, thinking I didn\\'t get the seal right. But there\\'s a slow leak somewhere and after a soap test, it\\'s not the filling valve. Upper baffle on the second one failed to keep the air in, and we\\'re returning it and avoiding Intex.  We\\'ve been using inflatable pools from other manufacturers for the last 7 years, so it\\'s probably not us. The seller approved a return right away, the only saving grace on this. Trying one we got (same size) from K mart, and it has an air valve just like the ones we used to get from Walgreens, that could last up to two seasons.  The larger valve has a rubber gasket that plugs the hole and then a screw-on lid that goes over - no guesswork involved. It has a much simpler and separate mouth blow up valve a few inches away. The downside is that you could lose any of the four little parts, but the upside is that it\\'s not hard to open, close or know it\\'s sealed correctly the first time. And, since the pool are clearly not meant to last, you can save those parts and grab one if you lose it the next season.   Let\\'s hope we get the remainder of the year out of this one!   Update: air is holding in the Clearwater - and that make is available on Amazon, I just didn\\'t know it.\"\\n\"The package was open and there was only butterfly, the others was not in it.\"\\n\"These are cute but beware.

I saw another reviewer of the camera version by another seller say the same thing.\\n\"Glasses didn\\'t work fresh out the box. Wanted to use these for the BlackLightRun, instead of paying for an overpriced pair there. But these didn\\'t work at all. The other items I was wearing that glowed in the dark and/flashed made these translucent pair look like it was doing something. I just looked &#34;cool&#34; with a pair of glasses that didn\\'t work on my face. I had brought these because I have Amazon Prime, so I knew that I would receive them in time for the event. Since it comes in a pack of 12, I planned on getting their early and selling the rest.

Feel apart in 5 mins!\\n\"I got these paints to add to an art box for my sons 9th bday. He was excited. I chose these because they claim to be washable and in a house with 4 children that is always important. One night my son went in his room to go to bed and found his 3 year old brother, who has an earlier bedtime, covered from head to tow in brown paint. As was the floor (carpeted), his bedroom door, and many of his toys. The brown was not a product of one tub of brown paint. It was the product of all 10 tubs of paint mixed together on the floor. After giving the child a bath, wiping up as much excess paint as possible, washing toys and the door, I took out my $300 carpet cleaner and got to work cleaning up the WASHABLE paint from the carpet. 45 minutes, an entire bottle of detergent, and dozens of water changes later and our carpet is still stained. The mess was my sons fault. I am not faulting crayola for what my son did. But these are not washable by a long shot.\"\\nI thought it was the disneyland one so i got for my son birthday then when i got home from work and saw the dinosaur it wasn\\'t the one from disneyland it the one from the disney store\\n\"The box art shows the orange track going directly under the crane with the car seemingly driving toward the crane. And the actual photos posted here show the car driving AWAY from the &#34;rocky&#34; side of the crane. If either was accurate this stunt might be ok.<br />  However the cars only seem to make it under the crane (to clear it or engage it) by traveling forward ACROSS the rocks TOWARD the crane -- traveling the other way, the way pictured, causes almost every car tested to get stopped and possibly stuck under the back, or lower end, of the crane.<br />  Trying to drive cars the way pictured: regardless of the claw, cars rarely stay on target to enter under the crane; the slippery &#34;rock&#34; surface and wide &#34;mouth&#34; of the entrance to the crane almost always makes the car crash. Even if the car misses the swinging claw, it crashes, making the stunt pointless. Have tried it with dozens of cars; over the last year we even pull the stunt back out of the toy box every few months to see if we can get it working but we always end up frustrated. We use other stunts every day that work great; try the Quick Kick Loop or Barrel Roll instead.\"\\nOverpriced on Bungie store they are selling the same one with an extra piece for $190.\\n\"Came torn, unable to use\"\\nProduct arrived defective.

The jump rope is super lite rope and is hard to use because it\\'s like trying to jump rope with string. The kite is garbage and doesn\\'t fly & I\\'m sure that it would rip in a second if we got it to. The pail is super flimsy and you can do better at any grocery store or drug store in the summer with a better quality pail and shovel.<br /><br />Thankfully this was an &#34;add-on&#34; gift and I had gotten her some nicer stuff and this was just a fun summer-y thing, but if this is your main gift, you can do SO MUCH BETTER (for a lot less) with items by Melissa & Doug or things along those lines.<br /><br />I\\'d pass on this one - Disney is just trying to make a buck here. Bad Disney :(\"\\n\"very cheap looking,  I sent it back. Never got something this trashy through Amazon before\"\\n\"Definitely not a Disney product, but my son thinks he\\'s cute....I guess\"\\nGET THE OLD GAME<br /><br />This new &#34;improved&#34; version really stinks.

This is a Fake, Chinese Knock-Off!\"\\nBroke the first time we hooked it up.\\n\"I am a very ANGRY mother because of this product. My son who celebrated his 1st birthday on Aug 8th received the Sit-to-Stand alphabet train for his birthday from my sister. The age on this product says 12-36 months. At first I loved this toy. My son loved this toy. All the sounds and lights, it kept him occupied. Until last night. My son started screaming and then fell. I rushed over to him to find that his entire arm was lodged inside the shoot on top of the train that\\'s meant for the alphabet blocks. His arm was stuck inside the train all the way to his biceps. He\\'s lucky that when he fell, he didn\\'t break his arm. He\\'s just learning to walk so his balance is weary. Took me 5 minutes to get his arm free from this toy. My husband almost broke the toy out of worry if we were gonna ever free our son\\'s arm. I took multiple pictures of my son\\'s arm, that happens to be red and swollen around his elbow and up. I am very angry! This toy almost broke my 1 year old\\'s arm!!! Whoever created this product needs to be fired for over looking the block shoot on top of the train. For &#34;one of the top toy manufacturers,&#34; I expected better. I WILL NEVER BUY A VTECH TOY EVER AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS!!!!!\"\\nCute idea but started unraveling almost right away.\\n\"Absolutley a piece of junk.  My grandson used it for about 1 week and it wouldn\\'t steer any more. It was not broken up or abused, just stopped going left or right.  If you don\\'t mind going forward or backward enjoy!  I will go to the RC store and get him a new one that the manufacture will stand behind.\"\\nThese bracelets came all stuck together. They were difficult to separate and did not maintain it\\'s form once separated.\\nMy son was disappointed with poor paint quality and a couple figures being broken on arrival. We were using in a bag of misc items for party favors.\\n\"The picture was very cute, but I didn\\'t notice it was made of soy ink.  As I am highly allergic to soy, I will not be able to put together unless I wear gloves and hope it doesn\\'t get in the air.  As I am not the only person in the world allergic to soy, the warning should be predominate.\"\\n\"the t-rex we recevied had a hole in his throat... we tried to patch it, but it just looks like he should have quit smoking, or stayed away from indominus rex.  The head portion deflates within 30 min.  Mildly amusing because it looks like he is getting sleepy as the air slowly dissipates.\"\\n\"Very misleading, thought I was getting three rings but this product only ships one ring.\"\\nThis product don\\'t store to much... it keeps collapsing\\n\"the product wasn\\'t what I expected. When I unrolled it the sheet was bent. In addition the directions on how to apply it were vague. Lastly the product took forever to get delivered. I bought a different wall art from another company, but it was so easy to apply because the product was durable and ready to adhere to the wall\"\\nLove it\\n\"I have a large head. Hat size is 7 3/4 to 7 7/8. I bought the XXL version of this helmet. It did NOT fit. I decided to remove some of the foam padding inside the helmet so that I could wear the helmet. Eventually, I got the helmet on. It was uncomfortable, and tight. I felt that I removed enough padding to make the helmet ineffective. It\\'s now in the trash. If you have a large head, DON\\'T buy this one.\"\\nThe bar part worked just fine we went to blow up chairs and all but one did not work . one the cirlcle part on seat was pulled away allowing air to excape the other two would not hold air at all. We are very disappointed .\\nseat ripped first time down the river\\nThis kite broke on its first use. I can get a better quality kite at the dollar store.  So disappointed.\\n\"It breaks too easily, and now the won\\'t let me return it. The darts keep popping out too the point they will not shoot out. Don\\'t waste your money.\"\\nThe bottle is very small and not aluminum  at all\\nOnly held air less than s month.  i would not recommend.\\nReceived this float. I am really disappointed. It came and someone else had returned it. It was missing the rope that goes around it and it was very filthy inside and out. Piece of junk. It also had a hole in it. Not worth retuning and spending money to send it back. Vendor not reliable with this product\\n\"I wasn\\'t expecting much from this, but I was at least expecting the little arms to hold a piece of chain-nope.  Not worth the effort to even send back.\"\\n\"Plane was covered in dirt and dust when I pulled it out of the box.  Completely disgusted that I couldn\\'t even give this to my child.  I had to thoroughly was it.  Then after I had it cleaned, the screw for the battery compartment was stripped, so we can\\'t even get a battery in for the lights to work.  I think maybe it was used.  Don\\'t buy this plane, get one of the planes from Green Toys, USA made.\"\\nWithin an hour of setting up this pool it had a separated seam in the ladder section.

Not worth $7 bucks, you\\'re better off buying something from the grocery store.\"\\n\"Cheap crap with misleading photos on the box. It\\'s a 21-step assembly and my son broke one of the legs just trying to assemble the tiny parts. It doesn\\'t move when built; I have taken apart and tried to get it working three times with no result. Hours of wasted time and a disappointed kid who now wishes he\\'d spent his money on something else. I\\'m starting to realize there\\'s a whole industry of cool-looking, &#34;science-y&#34; toys that you open up and realize are just plastic crap.\"\\n\"One broke with in the first hour, the other a few weeks later. Not very kid friendly for a toy. Very disappointed.\"\\nOne of them is broken. It stays lit up whenever the batteries are inserted and can\\'t be turned off. I need to return them for a new pair that works.\\n\"We want to love this toy, but it arrived open, used and broken on our 7 year olds birthday. He\\'s been begging for this toy for a year, and we wouldn\\'t normally splurge so much, and bought it against our better judgement. While it\\'s super cute and likely loads of fun, I doubt I will order an electronic toy from Amazon again. This toy is so obviously used and restocked and made our kiddo cry. But I guess lesson learned, always inspect your items and don\\'t wait to open the box at the last minute. I do understand that some items are defective, but this is a major oversight. My husband is running around town looking for a replacement now... such a bummer! UPDATE: We did get another. But I can\\'t say I am impressed with this toy. Perhaps it\\'s just the let down after all the hubbub, but it seems rather one dimensional and finicky. Falls over and crashes a lot. Doesn\\'t really obey claps, motions etc. It got some giggles at first, but both kids seem a little let down, and like they might lose interest.\"\\n\"Broke after 2 hours of use. The rim began to seperate from the backboard.  Returned for refund. Purchased Swim line 9195, much better design.\"\\nI have used this trick before but didn\\'t need to buy this item. you can just as easily burn the strike strip of a match box in order to get the substance. This saves you money and shipping time.\\nMissing antenna\\nI have several drones and wanted to add this one to my collection. Fairly simple startup routine. The quad would only try to flip over. It acted like one of the gyros was bad. (I\\'m an EE). Over the next 3 days I went back and forth with the tech support in China. They wanted me to replace a motor and I said no. Finally they said I could send it back at my expense for a refund. I could not see spending more money. Chalk this up to only buying Prime.\\nNot a fan of this. After buying I find I would rather actually read a book to my child.\\n\"The battery lasted 4 months, then would not charge anymore. The charger blinks red which indicates a bad battery. I\\'m now reading there is no warranty. For 50 dollars there should be some sort of warranty, at least 1 year. Not very happy with this purchase.\"\\nWay too expensive!!\\n\"I cannot stand this train set. We have the garage and airport as well. Everything has to be configured exactly because there aren\\'t very many pieces. If you don\\'t do it exactly then it won\\'t work. There is probably a way to make the train set attach to the garage and airport but I don\\'t feel like spending an hour of my time figuring out how. As a mom, I\\'ve got better things to do and my almost 4 year old can\\'t make a complete set on his own. The trains and other vehicles go over a part that is supposed to talk. They often get stuck and just stay in place while the wheels move and make an awful awful clicking sound until you free it. If it\\'s self propelled then why does it get stuck all the time?  I seriously hate this toy and hide it every chance I get. The wooden Train tracks are better because they configurations are limitless and so much easier (and cooler). They also don\\'t sing dumb songs or get stuck.\"\\nReally bad toy. Was disappointed how cheap this toy is.\\nThin material and my thumb went threw it..\\nThey break too easy. Screws strip out to easy.\\nI came broken. Can\\'t say anymore\\nNever came to life?\\nDO NOT BUY REDCAT.  The RedCat volcano we purchased broke the first week we bought it and the retailer would not accept returns and diverted us to Redcatracing.com an office in Phoenix AZ with rude customer service (James) and incompetent manager (Bill) who sent me a non working charger (3 times) until the ESC controller got damaged from a 9v charger they sent me which should have been 7.2 v. By then 90 days had passed and they rejected my claim by saying: &#34;I\\'m sorry but your car is out of warranty and we can\\'t do anything for you unless you send us a check&#34;. When I explained the car was damaged due to the wrong charger they had me pay for the repair ($55 plus shipping). They shipped it back with melted face cover and a non working charger that came apart the minute I took it out of the box. I had to ship it back because the vehicle was stalling every 2 minutes. In total I spent over $100 in parts and handling expenses and my RedCat still does not work.  When I asked for a new charger they denied me my claim and hung up the phone on me (James). When I spoke with the manager he falsely accused me of improper language (which I would never do) and said they would not help me with my truck.  I don\\'t know what is worse the quality of these vehicles or the customer service from RedCatRacing. This is the worst RC experience I\\'ve had in my life and will NEVER BUY REDCAT AGAIN.\\nIt\\'s a bootleg.\\n\"I bought this product for my son last Christmas and let me just say, to anyone who\\'s reading this review, this thing is an unbelievable piece of junk.  If it were possible to give zero stars, I would.  The mark-up on this item is criminal, it can\\'t have cost more than 5 cents to make.  It\\'s basically a box within a box.  It\\'s just thin plastic packaging with stickers on it.

This would pretty much sum up the whole costume experience.<br />&#34;The best news: I wore the costume on Halloween to be funny. Then the next day I took it off, and I was just me again.

Was not dropped or treated poorly because I was showing my son how to transform it when it broke.  He had not even touched it yet.\\nthey broke before we could install them.\\n\"I really dislike the design of this toy.  My son seems ok with it, but it\\'s such a wasted opportunity to make a great pirate ship.  The boat sticks to the wall and is really only a half boat, cramped for space, so that\\'s nowhere near as fun as a free-floating boat.  The pirate actually sinks to the bottom of the bath, as does the little dingy boat, there are no real moving parts on the ship except the wheel on the back which inexplicably rotates for no apparent purpose. you can pour a little water through the bell, but the opening is the size of a thimble.  the pirate isn\\'t well balanced so he falls off the tower a lot.<br /><br />Really disappointing product.  Lots of potential to great creative with a pirate ship just wasted here.\"\\nVery cheap made toy!! A piece broke on it within minutes of the boys playing with it.

But the &#34;Original Metal Slinky&#34; label that immediately follows it in this post implies that it isn\\'t a miniature version, but the ORIGINAL version. I had an original version as a kid and this isn\\'t the original. The original was large enough to go down the stairs, which is the best part of a Slinky. This one doesn\\'t go down the stairs. Or I should say, this one doesn\\'t go down the stairs, unless you kind of throw it forward and try several time to get just the right amount to thrust to keep it moving forward enough to make the trip.

Aside from the fact it was difficult, some plastic parts was uneven and could not fit each others\"\\nSome of the inflatables had small holes in them\\nI pre-ordered this item to ensure I would get the one I wanted.  I patiently waited for the item to come and when it finally arrive it was the wrong item.\\n\"Horribly made. I got it as a surprise for my son and he put it in the water and it went about 3 feet before it stopped working. The seam was missing so the water just leaked right in to the wires. Now I am unable to return as there\\'s a 30 day return policy and I bought it in advance so by the time my son opened it, it was already passed that 30 days. So if you are going to attempt to buy, make sure you open and use right away.\"\\nThis Hot Wire Foam Cutter didn\\'t even get hot. It was useless for our project.\\nBottom rips to easy.\\n\"Its a fun toy that I enjoy, but it does not make any noise because they batteries were dead when I received it.\"\\n\"I added this to my son\\'s birthday wish list by mistake... thinking it was lego. I am so disappointed in this product! Pieces keep falling apart, images in the directions are difficult at best to follow. I can\\'t for the life of me get the wheels and engines to stay in place.<br /><br />Simply said, you pay for what you get. While the \\'real\\' lego plane is over $200, I\\'m willing to spend it for a higher quality product. I\\'ll be sure to read the labels better next time\"\\n\"Sadly - they really need some quality control on this item. I have received 3 of these sets (Amazon kept replacing them) and each time they either arrive with broken pieces, or easily fall apart in days. Maru\\'s mask breaks off instantly, drips chomper falls off and can\\'t be reattached, blackouts blade broke off within days, and deer\\'s wheel fell off! Sigh. We have almost every planes toy they sell and this set just seems to be a total dud.\"\\n\"I purchased this for my nephew, who loves Big Hero 6.  When it arrived, the right arm fell off immediately.  I found the return policy to be very simple, and requested a replacement.  When the second one arrived, the left arm fell off immediately.  The problem is that the arms are connected to a very flimsy plastic piece inside the body.  My nephew never even had a chance to break them since they were broken right out of the box.  I would not recommend this to anyone, especially if you plan to give it to a child.  The only purpose it could serve is sitting motionless on a shelf where you don\\'t know the arm is broken.  Very disappointing.  One star is really too high.\"\\nI purchased some about seven years ago they are now starting to fail! I love them the ones I recently purchased are horrible they started to come apart after one use! Would not purchase this type again not all one piece as the other one was from Swim Way the orange one is the older one!\\nThe eyeholes are placed real awkwardly on my face and it was so cheap quality\\nIt popped within a few hours of inflating it!  Doesn\\'t hold up.\\nBroke within 1 hour of first use!\\nVery disappointed with this tape.  We went to put it down on the caret to put with my son\\'s wooden railway to make rail road crossings.  The tape does not stick very well to the carpet and comes up as he is driving things over it.  I was using plain masking tape which worked great but liked this because of the road design.  One the tape is gone we will be going back to masking tape.\\nArrived damaged.\\n\"Like everyone else, couldn\\'t figure out the hose until hours (after the slide tore), when I realized you just put the female side of the adapter around the rubber nipple then attach your hose.  Meanwhile, it busted a 4-5&#34; hole in the tubing (poor design -- applying pressure to the water bladder at the bottom will rupture the built-in hose seam.  It lasted all of 1 hour.  Stay away -- stay far, far away.\"\\nI won\\'t be purchasing anymore heli\\'s from Air Hogs. They spin out of control and crash.

Cheap damn toys.\"\\nvery easy to broken\\n\"Might be good, who knows the charger has loose contact. (I know this for a fact because I disassembled the charger to see what is wrong)<br />The copter looks great, might even fly well, but I want a replacement charger. I bought this to play with on vacation, so I got it with prime shipping to get here fast. So much for that. The little molar style connection in the charger is the cheapest build I\\'ve seen. I CANNOT recommend this to anyone. Now if someone were to send me a GOOD replament charger. BEFORE I leave for vacation in three days my review may be updated.\"\\nThis radio is such a cool idea!  My 11 year old son had a great time building it.  He listened to his favorite radio station for 2 days and then the radio stopped working. It was very upsetting that something he had worked hard on stopped working. Maybe we just got a defective one.\\nNot a good toy.\\nThank God it was a 3 pack.  2 were leaking.  It looked like a sharp object penetrated the 2 and missing the 3rd one.\\nWay too small.\\nItem defective out of Box\\nNope. They definitely don\\'t work. changed out batteries provided too. Just sits in the water. Tried several times. No response. My mermaid loving daughter is very disappointed.\\nI was very unhappy with this product.  Two of the balloons had holes in them and the 2 heart balloons popped while walking out of the store we had them filled up at.  Not sure what the problem was but it\\'s disappointing when you are counting on them for your decorations!\\n\"EXPENSIVE and DEFECTIVE.  This is our second one, the tail refuses to stay on this one also,  manufacturer defect and a VERY bad one at that.  Worst TMNT figure we have ever purchased.  My son has been wanting Karai for quite some time, however if he picks her up, her tail falls off and he gets upset.\"\\n\"This is cute, but mine only works 1/4 of the time. Most of the time when the button is pressed nothing happens. Every now and then it decides to work, but at this point I don\\'t even try. I\\'ve replaced the batteries, but it still does the same thing. My baby is 3 weeks old and the gloworm has had this issue for the past 2 weeks. I hoped it would have lasted longer than this.\"\\nThe tumbler would not rotate. I returned it.\\n\"UPDATE: 1 star review As other reviewers stated, ours began to lose air in all the attractions except for the gator. The pool itself was fine, but I paid an exorbitant price for the bells and whistles not for a simple bowl with water. It lasted about 30-35 days and 5-6 uses. The only redeemable thing was that we were able to attach the gator to our above ground pool and use it for a ball toss. I do not recommend this.  PREVIOUS REVIEW; Our 16 month old loves the pool, the sprinkler, and the alligator ball toss. We had no issues setting up or keeping it inflated. My only complaint is that the slide is nothing more than a seat; even completely filled with air, it\\'s too soft and too \\'plastic\\' for sliding. It is pictured with 6 balls; ours came with 4 balls.  We ended up hooking the tube for the sprinkler up to a recirculating pump so that the pool would not overflow/be freezing cold.  I would recommend this purchase.\"\\nIt in now way will support a 27 inch doll as advertised.  The base is to small plus the extention much to losely attached.

The picture shows four water cannons so we purchased two sets. I thought we were getting a total of eight until they arrived and there were only two! After reading the fine print on the item description I see that it does state that only one cannon per order.  OK, fine, my bad, learned my lesson and will read the description next time.

Will be returning.\\n\"Great idea, but poor quality and poor design.  After a month of light use, one of the BBs got stuck in the down position.  Also, the magnet on the pen is so strong it makes it hard for kids to use the product.  Not recommended at all.\"\\n\"Poor quality - every other balloon broke while adding water or immediately thereafter - despite effort to under fill.<br />(But, yes, the balloons were brightly colored in the package.)\"\\n\"Mine arrived and didn\\'t look at all like the picture.  Apparently, there is a skeleton version of the parrot, and that\\'s what I received.  Totally black, grey, and white, with a little color on the tail.  Wings were skeleton, eyes were empty sockets.  Will be returning this one!\"\\n\"What a huge disappointment. The pieces do not securely fit together, it only comes with one vehicle, the windmill is stiff and barely moves, it\\'s hard to move vehicles on the track because of the smart point stations being raised, and like all vtech toys the voices and music is so incredibly annoying. And there\\'s no volume control. Do not reccomend.\"\\nThis isn\\'t Super Saiyan God Goku it\\'s some weird looking go-bot looking thing. Lol wow this is too funny!\\nThese are cheap Chinese knock-offs of actual LEGO products.  Art and designs are stolen from LEGO.\\nArrived with Multiply wholes\\nterrible\\n\"You\\'ll be lucky to finish one of these. The tabs to join pieces together are often too short to actually get a grip to twist them and do not tear as easy as the instructions say. Some of the smaller pieces are too flimsy and easily split when you bend it. Some parts require you to create a curve, and unless you get it right the first time, you might as well toss this in the recycling bin. The instructions are terrible, often putting steps before others that make that task harder than if they had rearranged them in a better order; especially if you buy the 3-piece tool kit they sell for these sets, which are too big to get inside or between pieces.\"\\nBUYER BEWARE! Our toddler (almost 3 years old) falls out of this bed all the time!! It has nothing to prevent her from falling out while asleep. We bought an extra guard rail to put along her bed but it was too lon and did not fit. The standard guard rail will not fit this bed. If you do not want your child falling out of the bed at night - DO NOT BUY THIS BED!\\nI don\\'t like paying for FAKE cards. The shadows under the text and card material were the dead giveaway this was a fake card. Disappointed that CCG Unlimited would sell such cards. smh\\nNot worth the price I paid.

Don\\'t bother.\\n\"Ive owned two variations of this tube, (and many many Intex tubes over the last 10 years),the first had no slot in between the seats (which fills up with another 10lbs of water BTW) or a cooler section. This older model tayed inflated and was smaller and more maneuverable. A) You cannot fill the cooler with ice and drinks because it adds about 50lbs to tube and lets face Intex makes the worst floating coolers ever. That thin little velcro strap doesnt hold up to 50lbs of drinks and food should the tube turn over. The first thing to go on mine were both headrests. Both flat within an hour each. Then the tube itself slowly leaked where I had to drag the under inflated tube the last 100 yards of the river. Theyve bitten off more than they can chew clearly. Why not just add a grill and foot rests to it as well. Do yourself a favor, get two single tubes, you\\'ll have better luck...\"\\nIts confusing non stable I don\\'t recommend for anyone!

Battery compartment is not waterproof. Bubbles always got inside and ruined batteries.\\n\"I just used my Swimline Floating Mult-Game Gameboard for the first time today, and as soon as I brought it into the pool, it started to slowly sink. Floating is really the only thing this gameboard is supposed to do, so it\\'s useless if it doesn\\'t float.<br /><br />First of all, the normal very small waves and movement of water that you\\'ll find in pretty much any pool, hot tub, lake, river, etc. will go up onto the board and fill the trays that are around the edge of the board. That\\'s annoying, but not heavy enough to sink it. After examining it a bit I discovered how it is supposed to float, and why it doesn\\'t.<br /><br />The outer rim of the board is made of hard plastic and is supposed to be sealed with air on the inside. This air is what makes the board float. However, it\\'s not sealed. The top and bottom are held together with cheap plastic pins, which fall out easily. By the time I noticed this, 3 of my pins had fallen out. I only ever found 1 of the missing 3, so I don\\'t know whether it was shipped with 2 pins missing or they just fell out sometime between receiving the board and entering the pool. So the pins fall out, then it\\'s not sealed, then water easily gets into the compartment that is supposed to only have air in it, and then it starts to sink.<br /><br />Also, now that I have it home, I can\\'t figure out how to get the water out. There\\'s no orientation that will make the leaky spots a low point to let the water drain from.\"\\n\"Terrible quality.  Stopped working after 5 minutes.  We tried everything, and have had people who know these toys look at it.  Nothing fixed it.  The seller would not take it back, because it was after the 30 day mark.  I had bought it early for a birthday gift.  The child was very disappointed.\"\\n\"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

We didn\\'t have any problem attaching to the hose, filling or having them fall off.<br /><br />However, as soon as they fell off the water started leaking. We couldn\\'t hand them out quick enough to 40 eager kids before the balloons were empty. It wasn\\'t a defective bunch because I had 2 packages (each with 3 bunches) and none of them worked. They are sealed with tiny elastic and they weren\\'t tight enough and the water squirted out of all of them.

Other than the Supreme brand stickers the maybe 30 or so other brand name stickers were things like MasterCard, Crocs, mcdonalds, Chanel, umbrella corp, silly no name/nonexistent automotive lubricant brands, and a single awful looking Adidas sticker. And the rest was all just poorly animated children\\'s sticker book nonsense and the kind of stickers that a pediatrician would give his patients. So basically, unless you\\'re a nurse or elementary school teacher, DON\\'T buy this. Oh yea and practically all the stickers I got in this pack had a thick 3-4mm width white border around the edge of each sticker, which made makes proper sticker bombing pretty much impossible. =[\"\\n\"If I could give this a 0 I would.

I got a glow city football for a present a while back which matches with a real youth size football so i ordered this one for a 12 year old thinking that it was the one I had, but there\\'s no way I can give it to him.  I wish they would have used real sizes to describe this. This is a good size for a 6 or 7 year old.\"\\n\"I bought 2 pairs of motors, 2 CW and 2 CCW motors. 1 CW and 1CCW motors are good, the other CW motor is is completely dead and does not do anything, the other CCW motor oscillates CW then CCW  randomly and sporadicly. I have not written any other reviews yet so this is the first for any product I purchased on amazon. Quadcopter and motors have not been flow yet, so the defective motors can not be blamed on a crash or overheating. A good known esc has been used to test the motors so that can not be blamed either. I was really excited about using all of the motors. Now I will look for another source and get another pair.\"\\nBought this for my 13 year old daughter to hang out with her friends.  The very first time they used it one of the neck rests pulled away from the base and the entire thing deflated.  There was a big tear where the head rest was supposed to stay attached to the base.  Non-repairable.  Bought this because other reviews said it was better quality than expected.  What a bummer and loss of money.\\nWhy does it come with only one pillow？\\nLasted 2 days. Even with fresh batteries she no longer is able to get a sufficient charge to be able to fly. She just spins slowly.\\nMy grandson loved this truck. It would have been worth the price if not so cheaply made. It broke after about 30 minutes of play. Would not trust a  replacement since the cheap material was the problem.

My wife bought this slide at Marshall\\'s, not Amazon. However, I still want to provide some feedback on this product as it may be helpful to others. Various kids, age 6-12, enjoyed this slide in our pool for two weeks. I placed the slide on the side of the pool as instructed. I even placed towels underneath the slide to prevent the concrete from wearing any holes in the slide. The kids were always supervised and never any over-the-top rough house activity which would have caused damage to the slide. All of the preventative actions I took could not have prevented what happened to this slide (see photo). The material separated at the seam, leaving it virtually impossible to repair with a patch, although we tried. I just spent 30 minutes with the duct tape to see if I can salvage this thing, but I think the slide will be in the trash. I would not recommend buying this product unless you have $ to burn.  This should be marketed as a disposable slide.\"\\nThere was only ONE pen in the box instead of 12! :(\\nWas very shoddy sewing on the items I recieved.

The second one lasted for a short time and then also stopped working. Obviously, we decided not to buy another one.\"\\n\"I purchased this as a gift for my grandson who lives with me.Of course hes too young to purchase his own stuff. Anyway, he kept seeing the commercial and loved loved loved it as much as a four year old can love things. Well, I went on Amazon, read the reviews,which by the way, were pretty awful. I purchased it anyway because I didn\\'t want to break his little heart. Don\\'t do what I did. The other reviews are correct. The item is pretty well made although it is plastic. It did hold up well. It is impossible to control the motions of this toy without a college degree. The four year old found it scary and only played with it approximately 10 times. The adults found it annoyingly loud and also couldn\\'t control it using their college degrees. This item is expensive for a toy that barely got used and is collecting dust under a bed.\"\\n\"filled them up in water, then watched them shrink to nothing before the party started.  ended up having to fill up other balloons by hand.\"\\n\"Counterfeit product.<br /><br />Confirmed counterfeit at local retailer, and independently by two electrical engineers.<br /><br />Do not buy.

It looks awesome, but it just doesn\\'t fly right.  Something is way off balance and it suddenly pulls left and nose dives into the ground every time.  We have lots of those cheapo plastic kits and they don\\'t do this.  We gave the kite another chance yesterday in some decent wind and the same thing happens, even when the kite is way up high (good wind).  All of our other kits did fine in the same conditions.  The grommit (that you attach it to) even fell apart.  I\\'m not sure if this is a design flaw or whether we just got a dud, but it\\'s going back this week.\"\\n\"Dangerous toy.

My great nephew was celebrating his 8th birthday. I opened the decopac , it had batteries in it already. I turned it on it didn\\'t work.  I bought new batteries, turned it on still didn\\'t work.  Very Disappointed!\"\\n\"All reviews were paid for except one, meaning only one reviewer actually paid money for these.  I believe the one actual purchaser but this is to hopefully make some people that look for the one stars to think twice about all the 5 star reviews.  I will remove review when more post reviews that are not because they were given free.\"\\nLooks cool\\n\"Terrible range, terrible accuracy, terrible water copacity and doesn\\'t get anyone wet\"\\n\"Pros: Aesthetically the colors are very nice,  and accurate to the description,  as well as it is adorable looking.  Cons: Execution/Quality of the product is very BAD QUALITY.  I had such high hopes for this &#34;Happy Trails Giraffe&#34; but sadly mine came damaged with defective stitching down the back of the Giraffe,  and a HOLE as well in the back.  I don\\'t know if I got someone else\\'s Giraffe that they returned, or if this is how the Manufacturer intentionally sells it, but overall, it is very bad to sell this product in this condition.  It also is confusing to me why they would put the seam down the back in the area where the child would sit (constant pressure on the seam = rips tears holes, etc) with such poor quality threading?  It looked like a novice sewed up the back by hand, very sloppily,  and I truly wouldn\\'t feel safe to have my child sit on it with a hole in it.  The box it came in was also in bad shape as it looked like it was stepped on, crunched, ripped, dropped, etc. ...so not sure why Amazon even sent this to me to begin with? I would say it is priced high for this poor quality...it should really be a $35 item with this poor quality.  Unfortunately, for me, it has to go back as it is defective/damaged.  I haven\\'t decided if I will reorder and give it another try as I really love the look of this... but I certainly don\\'t need the hassle of getting another defective/damaged product.\"\\n\"I hate this crayons, since the product we have got is broken down in to pieces . Also the quality of the crayons was too low . I saw the same product for 50 cents in Walmart.<br /><br />Worst quality and too high in Amazon\"\\nI would rate this no stars if it were possible. My daughter received this as a gift and ended up with a ton of balls stuck on the top of her head. Each ball has a lot of little hooks that easily get tangled in hair. Took an hour to remove them all.  I will be sending a note to the consumer product safety commission. A child\\'s toy should never cause this type incident.  Clearly not for kids. For the safety of your child do not buy.\\nSpent way to much money on somthing that didnt last 2 months peice of crap! and on top of that now amazon says I can return it!\\nTerrible product. It turned my P2V into a hazardous flying machine. No Control what so ever. I had to crash land to get it down because it was darting left and right. It will not hold elevation. Put on the factory Blades and back to normal operation.\\nWe received this game for Christmas because it was all my daughter asked for from her grandparents.  What a dissapointment she received when it didn\\'t work.  The games was horrible.  It doesn\\'t even deserve 1 star.  It wouldn\\'t say together no matter what size we made the balloons.  She didn\\'t even get to play the game once it wouldn\\'t stay together.  We returned it to the store for another one and it was the same way.  So we got the money back and she bought a different game.\\nBuyer beware!!! Took forever. Came smashed!! And totally stuck in a crushed position. Logo is weirdly tiny. Zero stars! Negative stars!

Cheap materials. If you do decide to purchase this unit do it through Amazon. I purchased this directly through Privacy Pop.

I would not recommend this product if you\\'re a sleep walker.\"\\n\"I bleached my hair then after I rinsed it and let it dry I put in this hair dye. I left it in for an hour, rinsed it let it dry and my hair was brown, I had bleached it blonde. I redyed it and left it in for two hours and my hair was a darker brown. When I rinsed it it rinsed pink instead of purple. The dye itself was a dark purple but it made my hair brown, in the picture only one side of hair is purple, it\\'s my roots. The blonde picture was on my other device so yah. I want my money back, it only ruined my hair.\"\\nWhen it comes to Star wars funko pop the blue box is the original release.

Really disappointed!\\n\"Junk Battery, The battery came in today, I was hesitant to even buy it with all of the reports of bad cells but I tried it anyway because of the price..... Bad Idea!<br /><br />The first attempt at a charge has cell number 1 not able to take a charge over 4.00 volts, cell number 2 will not go over 4.14 volts while cell number 3 was fine at 4.20 volts. This batteries quality makes it a charging fire or crash and fire waiting to happen. Not safe.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went ahead and took a replacement battery to give it a try. I still had cell problems. Cell #1 was 4.20 volts and cells #2 and #3 were topping off at 4.14 volts. I decided to try something. I dropped the amps down to 0.2 and ran it again and after 2 hours gained both weak cells to 4.16, another 2 hours and I had pushed them all to 4.20 volts. After one flight they were equally discharged and all cells charged like they were supposed to at 4.20 volts. If you have weak cells try this to bring life to them. this can be done with old batteries with weak cells as well with a pretty fair success rate.<br /><br />Update on Battery #2 - I am done with these, they are dangerous.<br /><br />I just got to run it out in a field and not just in the back yard so I put a bit of stress on it.... I was just coming in to land at about 11.0 volts (ish) and it dropped to about 7 +/- volts. Apparently the battery shorts and looses a cell, had I not been on the ground rather than the 400 foot up I was just about a minute before this I would have lost my Hex-rotor. The voltage loss registered via on board telemetry and a battery warning device I added. These things are simply not safe for aerial flight.\"\\nNot a really good purchase for me coz it\\'s not what i expected the game to be.<br /><br />My kids didnt get hooked to this game like i hoped they would. Should have purchased the original version instead.  I thought they were regular buzzers to add some fun factor to the Pictionary game.

We were going to use it in our farm pond and it looked liked a lot of rocks and sand coold get into it through the back and make a mess in our pole barn.  It was really heavy and hard to move around when it was dry. I can\\'t imagine what it would be like trying to remove it from the sandy beach with all that water and sand draining out of it.

My 5 month old received this for Christmas and 2 months later it no longer worked.  Obviously there was no rough play .. she was 5 months old.  When the product did work it did not work very well.  The idea of the crawling Minnie appealed to us to help our little one learn to crawl.  If I said the doll crawled an inch I would be generous.  The hands and knees do not line up well with the floor so it doesn\\'t grasp it to move most of the time. Also after the button is pressed the movement only happens for maybe 10-15 seconds.  That\\'s not long enough for the doll to move very far even if the hands and knees did line up.

I repaired it after I spend 2 hours looking for all the parts that came off the plane when it hit the ground, I tried to straighten everything, attempted another flight only for the prop/motor gear to disengage after another crash, I had to split the plane in half to repair the gear only to loose the flap linkage on the next flight. (After another crash!) The plane is now officially GROUNDED! (Un-flyable.)<br /><br />My advice for BEGINNERS is to spend the extra dough and get a plane that has SAFE technology and a panic-button that automatically rights the plane when (not if) you loose control of it.<br /><br />My recommendation is: Sport Cub S RTF with SAFE® Technology (HBZ4400)\"\\n\"The description for this product is misleading.

If I could rate 0 stars, I would.\"\\n\"It switches between left and right beys, however for some reason using the right side gets the ripper stuck and makes it unusable..  so my son can only use it for the left beys.. since he only has one, its basically useless\"\\n\"this is bull s*** \\\\, you can buy the pecies seperated for at least 1-3 dollars each\"\\nThese are junk.

So what I have said proved you should not buy this product. Also you do not receive the message on the toy you have to send it do the toy and listen to it.  The last thing is if the mobile device is not within 30 feet you can\\'t get a message. This thing stinks.\\n\"Just like so many other toys being made these days, this had great potential and then it arrived and was super cheap. So flimsy and disappointing.\"\\n\"Very disappointed in the slide.  The plastic is thin and cheap, looks as if could break at any time.  Extremely frustrating to put together, none of the holes lined up.  Extra holes and bolts had to be added to the mounting plate to secure it to the platform for safety.  On top of all that, there weren\\'t even enough bolts to finish assembling the slide!!  We had to go purchase bolts to finish the slide before we could even attach it to the platform.  I wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone.\"\\nComplete and un-reconcilable overcharge for this component. This price is aprox. the normal market cost of the Naza M Lite flight controller and PMU/LED combined.

However,  the top of the float was defective!  It had a huge rip in the seam so I had to tape the float to keep my baby out of the sun. Also the top part was made incorrectly and I wasn\\'t able to fill up the whole thing due to it being sealed shut in the wrong place. Very disappointed.

I was waiting all day for the package and when it finally came, my husband set it up and my son crawled right through it. There was something shiny on the side that caught my eye so I looked closer and there was a large piece of metal exposed (usually covered by seam). The quality of this item is horrible and completely unsafe for children. Returning same day I received it.\"\\nThese balloons were absolutely terrible.  They are supposed to be hearts but if you blow them up large enough to look like a heart they pop in your face.  We filled them up with helium and they lost the helium within hours.

They are extremely poor quality and toxic, reeking like spray paint and gasoline, and they are made of something akin styrofoam. This is absolutely a rip off, Melissa and Doug toys are completely different, usually made of wood and high quality. I want my money back, there is no way I am letting my baby put this crap in her mouth.\"\\nThis is not a pet bed it is  doll house furniture.\\nThis one doesn\\'t deserve the four stars it currently has. The tail is tweaked straight out of the box so the light path is totally inconsistent and hard to product. Just picture it flying a little tilted at all times. Makes gain speed on one turn and lose speed on the other. Super annoying. One stars because it flys and the remote is cool.\\nDescription was (12 pack) so I assumed the quantity would be Twelve!  There was only ONE in the Package!\\nIt\\'s just a coloring book. Not worth the $10!  Saw the same book in a Frozen version for $5.99 at our local grocery store. Very disappointed.\\nThe product is too light blue colour. Not a good buy as i expected much more from stabillo. Dont buy this one..\\nPoor.  Tail detaches too easily due to the arm/jaw mechanism requiring so much leverage to operate and where the tail attaches  to the hind end is the most natural place to grab.  Hard enough to balance this toy to make it stand up as it is but with the tail snapping off constantly my little guy doesn\\'t enjoy his new toy.\\nThese are junk. They arrived missing characters and parts. My kids were so sad. Worst experience on Amazon to date.\\nFirst battery that I got would not take charge. Got new  battery. Try to send the original battery  back to Philly hobby. Did realize  some shipping places will not ship a NIMH.battery.

I\\'m going to give them 1 ☆ because they are pretty and pretty good shipping even though they don\\'t work lol\\nBoth were defective and started deflating only hrs after we blew them up.\\nUsed these once at the lake an the both ripped where they connect to the seat. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.\\n\"Makes really small balloons and they only last about 3 min filled, so throw them fast or they will leak out just sitting there. And reloading is a nightmare broke more balloons then got  on them.\"\\nThis toy is junk!  Fell apart within two minutes of my child playing with it. The dress fell off making it not float!\\n\"Not as raunchy as Cards Against Humanity (so I\\'ve heard) but this game is still too raunchy to be played with friends or family members unless you like to be asked such questions as whether or not you have engaged in rough sex (and other too-much-information questions). Yes, we have all made poor life choices but most of them deserve to remain private for a reason, not laughed at by others. I would definitely not purchase this game again.\"\\nJUNK .ONLY  HAD 1 NOZZEL\\nAll the ants were dead.\\nIt doesn\\'t fly for more than a second and after that it doesn\\'t fly at all. I would not get this at all.\\nWas a disappointment at the price. My grandson looked at it one day and hasn\\'t touched it since then.\\nThese tires are junk.... Spit the tread first day having them.\\nHollow plastic molds with cut out bottoms and my 3 year old did not enjoy playing with these as the did not stand up on their own outside of the pool.\\nHandle ripped after first trip downstairs to the washer.\\n\"The tail material is too fragile, now it\\'s broken\"\\n\"Adorable product, but none of the apps worked. Screen goes dark when apps try to load. It has new calculator, notepad, and timer functions but they are useless if the product doesn\\'t work. Returning today. So far the return process has been very smooth, thanks to Amazon.\"\\n\"We bought this for our sons outdoor birthday party.  One of the pins had a hole upon inflation that we patched.  Within ten minutes of putting the game outside another pin started to deflate.  When a third of a toy malfunctions within an hour it is junk.  I am returning for a refund because Amazon is amazing like that, but if you want to have a fun outdoor party game look elsewhere.\"\\nGood idea poorley made lid doesn\\'t stay on or fit very well\\nNo wires from motor to attach to battery. My son was very disappointed.\\nThis battery never worked from the begining. Said 100% charge but when it got to about 76% the computer would die. Then it started getting worse dying at 85% then wont take a charge at all.\\nThis brand is very cheaply constructed. Half the balloons did not fill and the ones that did leaked immediately. Very disappointed as we have used other brands with great success!\\nyuk\\n\"one of the four did not work, no power to motor\"\\n\"Super bummed. These dolls will not change color, what a pile. Do not waste your money.\"\\nBought this as a gift for a friend. I new the quality was not going to be perfect but each bill looked liked my dog chewd on it and then thrown into a plastic holder. What a bad purchase. Should have gone to a reputable dealer to make sure I get the quality I am looking for next time. I should have known better.\\nDO NOT BUY unless you are planning to use immediately. We blew up the balloons an hour before we needed them and let sit in containers of water. Within the hour - every balloon completely deflated and none of the planned games could be played at our child\\'s party. Horrible experience.\\n\"Followed instructions, seeds sprouted, then wilted, and the whole contraption got moldy.\"\\nIt broke the minute my nephew took it and hooked it up. Water just squirted out everywhere in mass quantities. Missed the return window so now he just has a broken sprinkler. Guess that\\'s what I get for shopping early!\\n\"Like another reviewer said, it doesn\\'t fit the drone. Actually, if you push in exactly the right way and with a ton of force, it fits, but it shouldn\\'t be that way. The original battery pops in and out smoothly.\"\\n\"Absolute Garbage.  Set my son\\'s Polar Express coal car (battery compartment) on fire.  Thankfully, I was near the sink and got it out, where it continued to smolder for a very long time.  Plastic wrapping completely melted in the battery well, train is a total loss.  Piece of junk.  Before anyone asks, yes, I installed it correctly, not my first RC -type battery.  What a mess, and over $100 down the drain, my son\\'s absolute favorite toy will need to be replaced.\"\\nI was very disappointed with this balloon.  It did not hold the helium.  I purchased it to go with the theme of my grandson\\'s birthday and it couldn\\'t even be used because it was down by party time.  If there was a way to post with no stars I would!\\nNot the greatest wig. I had to sew the cap on because the elastic stretched out. The wig is also incredibly heavy and it doesn\\'t stay on the head very well.\\n\"Got mine from Coolplay.<br /><br />Awful. Balance is so bad the quad just rotates and makes an awful noise. Addiitonally, some of the sets were (3) B props and only one A.\"\\n\"This is not an Aolong v2 is a Guanlong, don\\'t buy this! Scam!\"\\n\"waste of money, great idea, and if the reviews ever get better I might try again. but I had to return mine as I couldn\\'t even download the app so I checked reviews and (I should have done this first) saw all the poor reviews.  I will wait before trying again.\"\\nI understand random....but these are really random.  I don\\'t even think some of them are legos.  And a majority of them are super small peices.  Totally disappionted...but should have known.  Save yourself the trouble..just by a real set!\\n\"I made a mistake. All was written. No one to blame but me.<br /><br />I liked the MP3 playing capability.<br />I liked the quality of the sound<br />I liked the colors of the radio<br /><br />The dislikes<br />Battery life is real short.<br />6x C size batteries are needed and make it expensive to run. Don\\'t expect kids to turn off the radio once the cd is over.<br />If you thought like me rechargeable batteries would be best from day one. Right. Not even close.<br />No adapter packed with the radio. Whatever the reason, the up-sale is not nice.<br />Navigating the functions of the radio is hard and not natural.<br /><br />I ended up giving the radio to a charity 48 hours after delivery.<br />Went of a bluetooth kind of thing with lithium battery.\"\\nNothing grew. We tried multiple times.\\n\"So let me say at first, I LOVE this keychain for the first few days. Actually, I love it every day before turnip heads head snaps of the body. I\\'ve bought two of these so far and they\\'ve both met the same fate. Please choose another howls moving castle keychain, you may regret this one as I have.\"\\nCheaply made.  Strong smelling when open.  Splinters and on product wood filler used.  If looking for cheap set then this is it.  If you are looking for a product to keep for awhile this is not it.\\nMy kids loved this game for the first day until the winder for the string broke after setting up their second course. The string kept getting tangled and stuck inside.  I took it apart and fixed it twice in 24 hours. It\\'s going back to the store I purchased it at. Great idea but junky manufacturing.\\n\"False advertising, not the trenchcoat version. Feeling quite ripped off.\"\\n\"This little tiny flimsy toddler bed was difficult to put together.  Screws didn\\'t fit in correct slots, directions were difficult to follow.  At the end of this tough, time consuming ordeal, it\\'s worth the smile on our 22 month old\\'s face.\"\\n\"These are thin cardboard and when we received them, the corners were already running off. NOT worth it!\"\\n\"Do not buy, waste of money! Product was not as big as advertised want my money back\"\\n\"Sucks, would not buy again\"\\n\"Poor quality toy. Cheaply constructed, not like the other playskool transformers we have. We have the rescue bots playskool heroes\"\\n\"The product is good, but it took over a month to receive it.  Then I received 2 orders two weeks apart.\"\\nLike the past few reviews. The connectors just rips off. Everyone had a round tube and they all survived except this one. I would not recommend it.\\nDon\\'t waste your money. Not sure how they ever fit the number of stuffed animals in the picture unless the animals themselves were the size of a small rodent. It now resides at the local landfill.\\nIf you are buying this for anyone over 50 lbs. don\\'t waste your money. My granddaughter is 100 lbs. and she sunk to her nose. I was foolish enough to buy 2 and she put both of them together and her head was barely above water.  Very disappointing considering they show a young adult floating above water.\\n\"I love all things Deadpool, and I was so excited to find out that this sticker says it\\'s also recommended for use on a car.<br /><br />It wasn\\'t meant for cars.<br /><br />As I opened the sticker, I knew it probably wasn\\'t going to work as a decal. It isn\\'t cut like a decal, and it is made from a paper-like material just like a sticker. I gave it the benefit of the doubt because the item description states it\\'s okay for cars, and I applied it on my rear window just as I would a decal.<br /><br />It lasted three days before peeling on the edges, and because it got soggy, I can tell you right now it isn\\'t meant for vehicles. Save it for a laptop, a binder or anything that stays indoors, instead.\"\\n\", it wasn\\'t any paper inside for instruction, and the string never work very bad item\"\\nTakes too long to load and the image was sometimes really off.\\n\"This could have been great, however; one side had a rip along the side and there was no place to add candy. Four adults and four kids could not locate the place. If I had had time to return I would have so we just cut into it to add candy. Just very frustrating. Then to top it off its $6 cheaper a few days after I ordered it.\"\\nVulgarity for the sake of itself. Tries too hard to be funny and becomes boring quickly after the shock value wears off.

It didn\\'t hold air at all.\\n\"The colors were NOT red, green, yellow, and blue!\"\\nWhat a total rip off!!!! The picture on Amazon is very misleading.  You do not get what is pictured.  It is one little strand and very cheaply made.  This bracelet is worth about a quarter. Do not waste your money!\\nPurchased at the Disney Store.  Her hair is horrible! It\\'s impossible to brush or play with.  I\\'ve never seen such horrible doll hair.\\nThis says costume in the description.  It was only a mask! What are we supposed to do without a costume?\\nDidn\\'t last more than an hour. Had holes all over the seams.\\nMy grandson just loves this. He was always wanted to help his mom and me when he would come over. He will not let anyone use it but himself. The best thing I could have bought him. Thanks so much.

Fortunately,  my grandchild also likes dinosaurs so it wasn\\'t a total loss, but we were all disappointed.\"\\n\"First, it is very tiny. One star for size. Second, the top has broken twice. Kidkraft did send a replacement right away, but now it has broken again.\"\\nWouldn\\'t recommend this product. It\\'s junk\\nDid not work at all. Most of the balloons did not get full and the ones that did the water was coming out before the kids could get them. This was a birthday present for my kid.

She still has a lot of fun worker with it with wet washcloths or paint brushes.  The size just right for the toddler age range.\"\\nCollection cox was busted upon arrival.  Disappointed!\\n\"While we have shopped Amazon continuously for years,relying on the reviews, and never returned anything, in this case the reviews misled us. We lost pieces from a Milton-Bradley trouble game and tried to replace it with this one. However, the pop-o-matic die roller in this board is quite weak, very little pop, and so very often does not roll the die. Then, we need to decide whether it actually rolled or not, because if not we roll again. Often it\\'s hard to tell, which inserts an uncertainty into the game that does not help. Therefore, unfortunately we need to send it back.\"\\nThis &#34;adult&#34; coloring book series was obscene bordering on pornographic.

He loves orangutans but the one from the zoo had hair that shed all over everything and fell off in chunks in his mouth, which is where he puts everything because he is only a year old. This one had good reviews so I thought it would be a quality product but it is just as bad! We opened the bag that the item came in and there was hair in the bag that had fallen off in transit, hair stuck to the stuffed animal that had fallen off in chunks like our old cheap orangutan, and a seam that was sticking out of the side of the animal\\'s face. It sheds everywhere and is a very low quality item. I am sending it back and will never buy a toy from this company again. So disappointed.<br /><br />Another bummer is that the item is incredibly small, even for a young child.<br /><br />I have no idea why this product is so highly rated. I can only imagine it is because people are using this as a novelty item to sit on a shelf, from a distance, instead of as a toy that will be touched and hugged.\"\\nThis bag started off perfect. Everything fit that I needed. Until both zipper handles broke off. Now it is pretty much useless.\\nWig is cheaply made and more black and gray than bleach blonde. Looks more like it belongs in a horror movie.\\nThese would not stay on my ear at all.\\nEars do not have bones!!!\\nBalloon doesn\\'t float flat or straight so it\\'s like the horse is climbing something with his legs in the air. Also doesn\\'t hold the helium so it deflated within a day whereas most mylar balloons would float for weeks!\\nToo cheap\\nDrone flew for 5 minutes and one propeller stopped working.\\nNeeds to clearly post size of teenymate.  Was MUCH smaller than we thought\\n\"Absolutely HORRIBLE.  We love family game time but this was beyond miserable.  Instructions were obscure & might as well have been written in Morse Code Pig Latin.  Even drew a card with the wrong answer.  Really ? Stick to cards, Monopoly, or other classics - this was definitely a disappointment !!\"\\n\"When I bought this it was only $3.43, now the price is up to $8.  It wasn\\'t even worth what I paid for it.  It never worked, I tried buying new batteries, nothing worked.  It wasn\\'t worth returning, but I think that is how a lot of companies make out really, sell junky products to enough people at price that is enough to make a profit, but not high enough to be worth the effort and expense to return it.\"\\nLegs broke on the first day. Small\\nWay overpriced.  Very disappointing.\\nDo NOT buy this kite. There is NOTHING about it that is even close to the &#34;original&#34; bat kite in any way. Definitely try to read all the other reviews and make up your own mind. It\\'s kind of funny that this was actually put out by Gayla. They should be ashamed.\\nNice figure but came crushed.\\n\"Warming! The seller sell us the used and broken one, the car has a lot of scratch front of the car and back of the car, the car door is broken! I have never seen this kind of trap seller before! I have pictures and videos because it is for my boyfriend birthday gift, we took the picture and video when we opened it, then we found the broken pieces. And the sealed sticker is broken before we open it. See those pictures, we just open it and never use it.\"\\n\"These were terrible. When we filed them up, they were really small. Then, when I was unhooking the first attachment and doing the second set of balloons, the first batch was making all the water out and unable. I told the kids to grab the second batch and start using them before they all emptied, but they leaked way too fast. The ones that they did throw, wouldn\\'t even break. Everyone was so disappointed.\"\\nCute doll but yes it\\'s very much on the cheap side and the sound box is not worth it at all. It\\'s only worth half the price I paid and I got two. One for my daughter and one as a gift :(\\nBalloon doesn\\'t float flat or straight so it\\'s like the horse is climbing something with his legs in the air. Also doesn\\'t hold the helium so it deflated within a day whereas most mylar balloons would float for weeks!\\nHeavily used trashed\\nSuper noisy and have to change batteries too often\\n\"There is nothing authentic about this Backpack.. Beware you are getting a rip off. It comes horribly stitched and poor material. I should report this to Sanrio so they can have this user take down this backpack. I thought it looked awesome for my 5 year old. She so loves Hello Kitty. I was SO disappointed when I got it in the mail. I am also forced to come out of pocket to return it. Unfortunately, my 5 year likes anything that says Hello Kitty, so now I\\'m forced to repair it myself and just swallow the cost. If i can save anyone else the trouble of getting this backpack, its all worth it. Thanks for reading.. If i was you, I\\'ll move on to another Backpack. Stay away from this Rip OFF\"\\nKept ordering the police car but I kept getting the fire truck.\\nI received the wrong item.  I received a Nerd mini pillow instead of sweetarts.\\n\"There was a small cut on the outside of the bag it was pretty but was disa pointed about the cut , didn\\'t want to waste time returning because of hassles and also the shoulder strap kindda short\"\\n\"This set is very cute, but the truck is made of very low quality plastic. One side of the main body cracked right away into two very sharp, dangerous pieces when my 3 yr old grandson was pushing it around. I must assume it is meant to carry the sand toys but not actually be played with. It\\'s unfortunate because he really loved the truck and was not at all happy when we had to take it away or risk a nasty cut.\"\\ndoes not work not worth effort to comtinue with matter\\nWell the doll I recieved came with two left legs and the head would spin backwards and the power adapter was missing... I just want this doll to work right!! I need it for my upcoming haunted house this year! Been looking for a while for this type of doll.... And very unsatisfied with the outcome!!\\n\"Nothing froze like it said, horrible!\"\\nCame broken\\n\"Such a waste of money!!! Poor quality!!!

Very dissatisfied.\\nThree joints broke during assembly.  Waste of ten bucks.\\nThe figurine broke same day\\nWhy did you guys make the shoulder pads blue?????? Red or black!!!!! These would be perfect except for the color. I would have bought them if it wasn\\'t for that!!!!!!!\\n\"Arm broke off in 5 minutes, returned\"\\nIt came damaged with the box all bent. I do not recommend this product I will be reuturning it\\nTerrible beyblade no stamina at all\\n\"This is not an original Itazura Coin Bank. The product description states it is shipped from Japan (helping to ensure it is an original and not a knockoff), but this was shipped from China. Cat is not the same color as shown (cat has orange stripes instead of black), box is not the same as shown (there is English writing on it instead of Japanese), and the cat says &#34;thank you&#34; in a very badly recorded voice instead of &#34;meow&#34;. All let downs when this was supposed to be a gift of an original, not a knockoff.<br /><br />This is being returned. I\\'d give zero stars for this blatant misrepresentation of a product if I could.\"\\nI was super excited for this toy but was disappointed when it arrived. It was very cheap quality even for thirty dollars. I returned it and got my money back.\\nBroken\\nI ordered one and the one I ordered was delivered broken. It was made poorly. I am dissatisfied with the item. This item is probably worth somewhere between $25 and $50.\\n\"Only OK, very cheaply made\"\\nI bought these for Summer Bible Camp at my local Church.  I was very disappointed that they didn\\'t work at all.  Not a single bubble!  Maybe I got a bad batch.\\ndoes not work after a few days\\nMusic sounds for only few seconds. No song.

NOT HAPPY!\\n\"I was disappointed by the size and quality,\"\\nIt didn\\'t work when my granddaughter open it. So on that particular item definitely wasn\\'t happy.\\n\"Cards were counterfeit.

This vendor states to be aware of counterfeit versions, stating that label  should be laser etched; which it is NOT! It comes with a plain sticker label and pieces are made with the lowest quality standards. DO NOT BUY\"\\nJUNK!!!!\\nWas disappointed at the price and the fact it was not a backpack as described.  You cannot fit anything in this.  It is an adorable Abbey and maybe should be sold as just an Abbey.\\nIt arrived with 1 wing broken\\nNo stars doesn\\'t work!!!!  My farts are stronger!\\nTake a look\\nThis product is really for small toys only.\\nNot very comfortable and it had a hole in it within an hour of use. Amazon has a great return policy though!\\nCheap construction. Spend more get more.\\nThis was a waste of money. It\\'s very small and super loud. The pieces fall off too easily\\nI bought this thinking there were 5 flannel board stories. There was only one. The description says there are 5. I opened the package to check if the rest were in there somewhere and the cheap cardboard backing fell right off. The flannel pieces were pretty good quality though. I would have kept it had there been all five. One story with a cheap board is not worth $30+\\nThe ball is cracked and chipped. Very poor quality. Not worth the money or hope spent on it.\\nfake not good\\nStay away from these headphones.  They were purchased as a gift and they were broke within a month of use.  Not worth the headache when they break.\\nNot pink AT ALL! These are purple do not buy!\\nThey break so easily that we spend more time putting them back together than paying with them. The colors are wrong (why is Joy a white person? She\\'s yellow in the movie!) and the shapes are just enough off to be creepy. The mold lines are jagged. I don\\'t like them.\\nI didnt read the add and these are tiny clear plastic beads in a tiny bag.\\n\"Please avoid this product, its very thin plastic of bad quality. The first piece got broken after 2 weeks... The shuffel\\'s are bending under weight of wet sand, I hope they will not cut the hands of my children when they brake... I wouldn\\'t buy this product again!\"\\nWant worth the money at all.\\nJunk\\nSays it comes with mask and it didn\\'t . We bought it as a gift and couldn\\'t return it so very frustrated because they won\\'t send the mask.\\nThis was not the product I ordered. I researched all the different floats and chose the one that cost more cause it was the most updated and I got one that was about $15 less that o chose against buying. Not very happy!\\n\"The table is great. However, the paint on it bubbles. After about 6 months the green top started to get bubbles in it.<br /><br />I emailed the company and they promptly sent me another one. Less than two months later, the same thing happened.<br /><br />I haven\\'t contacted them again.<br /><br />This is highly annoying especially if you have to keep taking a train set apart to replace the top.\"\\nSays its a four count and only one came!  Just ordered again because I need it for my little girls birthday party bags!  Will see if four come this time!\\n\"Item did not function. Batteries were fully charged, but hovercraft would not lift off ground. Item was returned for a full refund.\"\\n\"I gave this one star because I am so fed up with the net.  No matter what you do the net keeps falling down.  It does not stay attached to the rim.  I googled it, watched videos on YouTube and other people are having the same issue.  I had to zip tie the net to the rim.  For the price such a disappointment.\"\\n\"The shapes are tiny, not very baby proof. If your baby puts items into his mouth...don\\'t buy it! It reminds me of a travel puzzle for a 3 yr old. Hope this helps! So the description says 1-3 more like 3yrs old not 1.\"\\n\"60% fail rate, just to give you an idea. I appreciate the idea, but these are useless at this price point of $9 even with 2 day shipping. I\\'ve had to result to the old fashioned water balloons.<br /><br />Thanks a lot.\"\\nvery poor quality.\\n\"Constructing anything with the magnetic tiles in this package is akin to a lesson in futility.  The magnets are weak and anything you build will fall apart. Now picture giving this to a 3 year old to play with - basically a cry fest every 5 seconds as whatever it was you built for them falls apart.<br /><br />I wanted to return it immediately, however my son liked the wheels so much we ordered real magna tiles (not these knock offs) to use with the wheel bases.\"\\nNot even close to what i expected. My daughter enjoyed it (BARELY INTERESTED) for a whole 2 days before the pens were dried and cracked and the mat started falling apart. She used it for maybe an hour total in those 2 days. I usually have no problems with the items i buy. But this is absolutely a regret in the purchase category.\\n\"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a niece do doodle/journaling. I was so disappointed to see how small this was, as well as how few pages there were. For the price, I expected more\"\\nSucked\\nprobably work but returned the drone\\nDefinitely made in China.<br />One size does NOT fit all.<br />I\\'d buy something else first if I were you.\\nVery poor quality set!\\nToday is my daughters birthday and we Woke her up to open her dollhouse gift to only see that it was ripped and torn dirty and had blue marker all over it. Someone had clearly returned this product before. And I should have known by the tape at the top of the boxbox and wasn\\'t at the bottom. Way to go people thanks for destroying my baby birthday!!!\\nCar received with 9 inch crack down the side. Was 150% disappointed!Will never order large items again!!!\\nNever worked! Returned for full return\\n\"Not what I had expected. I had bought two others from a different company, red and blue, and were of better quality. The handle is too thick, you can see the metal color of the screws attaching the handle, the white paint was chipped in a couple of areas, the bucket metal is too thin and easily damaged. Not what I expected. However, if you can paint it over, and cover the handle with a decoration, it will do its job for a centerpiece.\"\\n\"First, the pictured image IS NOT WHAT I RECEIVED!!!  The cable has an in line switch THAT DIDN\\'T WORK!!! I had to remove the switch in order for it to work. Beware, if you buy this, that you may have to remove the switch and either wire a new one or hard wire. Since they can\\'t seem to get the simplest electronic circuit right (or they have zero quality control), I would recommend doing it yourself. $20 battery (if you have an extra, will work just fine) plus less than $5 in parts easy.  I\\'m beyond sick of poor quality practices and I will not trust Geekria with any further purchases. Picture is after removing switch (there was no yellow shrink wrap).\"\\nIt sucks\\nA fake donut to fool someone should not look \\'fake.\\'  This does.  Too shiny looking to fool anyone.\\n\"My son accidentally dropped the remote the 2nd day he had the car.  Does not work any more :(  80.00 down the toilet. Poorly made. Not durable. Would be worth spending the extra money on a better quality RC product.  We bought another controller. Working again, but, still not impressed with the quality.\"\\nVery disappointed. Too big. Looks weird.  It\\'s horrible.\\nDon\\'t waste your money. The grandkids hated them.\\n\"Absolute toy and completely unstable, but it will fit in the palm of your hadn\"\\n\"I was watching TV with my 6 year old grandson, and we saw the commercial from whamo. The magic pen commercial made the pens look amazing, so I ordered them from Amazon (my go to shop). We received them and they were nothing like the commercial portrayed. I read the directions and these pens were nothing more than a regular marker. One of the pens leaked all over our hands, and the stencils were small pieces of papers that were impossible to take out the center without tearing the stencil. My grandson and I were so disappointed we threw them away. I would not recommend purchasing these pens there is nothing magic about them.\"\\nNot much of a toy for the price but the kid liked it\\nTatum Armstrong\\nMy DGD\\'s did not like this item...many very cheap pieces in the set .  Next summer I will get the dolls better swimwear.\\nProvides my 5 yr old granddaughter hours of fun and imagination!\\nThe description and picture is for a MASK COSTUME...that sounds like a costume and mask to me. This was just a mask. Terrible wording!\\nWhat a ripoff. I guess I should have read more closely but for that price I thought it was all three.  Almost $12 for a plastic container with a dozen plastic monkeys. NO!\\n\"Very cute shovel, just the right size. BUT the handle broke twice and had to replace it! So very poor quality of wood dowel!!!!!<br />I bought 2 others from a different company that have worn well!\"\\nBad\\n\"Less than a week into use, the arch over the top sprang a leak. I haven\\'t found a patch that works yet. Fragile as all heck.<br /><br />My kids love it and just flop the arch out of the way. it\\'s more drought-sensitive with the shallow splash pool.<br /><br />Previously we had a pricier slide that, like a bouncy house, had a noisy inflator running constantly. It lasted for years. This is quiet, but broken doesn\\'t get the cigar now does it?\"\\nDoes not hold a charge\\nIt cames broken\\n\"I brought this for my son Birthday Today ,he Started playing with it for about an hour an it Stop working...Not Worth The Money .I Don\\'t know Why they selling this bull .I\\'m Getting a Refund...\"\\nHahahahahah\\nMy fav coffee cup ever\\nyou get a bunch of random useless stickers\\nThe mounting hardware bag marked &#34;Phantom 3&#34; contained the same exact screws as the bag marked &#34;Phantom 1 & 2&#34;. None of them fit my phantom 3. It does not have the tools to install.\\n\"After I assembled the stroller, I placed my daughter (it was her birthday gift she just turned one.) in and as soon as she grabbed the handlebars and turned them, something snapped and now I can not steer the stroller at all.\"\\nThese are a waste of time and money!\\n\"Whether making high speed runs on the street or doing donuts in the dirt, the tires will balloon and rip apart. 3 sets of tires destroyed. Oh and now the battery wont charge on the traxxas id charger. It also will not fit in the battery bay, even with the purchase of the ecs and batter post extension kit.\"\\nWORST TOY BROCKE 2 DAY BAD!!!!!!!\\nExtremely disappointed! For the price I was u see the impression this was more than a small coloring book. Plus I paid almost $7 and the price listed on the coloring book retailed at $2.99. I paid 3x more than I should have.\\nHalf of the balloons had holes in and the other half didn\\'t seal after dropping off from the holder.  Not as nice as their add on TV.\\n\"I bought 2 of these, the both ripped shortly after.\"\\nThis is the 6&#34; figure. 1 leg is shorter than the other. No way it will stand by itself. Will need a support stand to keep this product standing vertical..therfore price is to steep. Don\\'t take it out of box.until you make sure the feet are even. Ok for a play toy.\\nDoesn\\'t stay inflated looses all air after 1 use.  Bought it for pool party blew it up a week in advance and it deflated prior to use. Too bad because it is a fun looking float. Don\\'t wast your money.\\n\"I wanted so much to give this a good review because it looked fun initially. However, I would never pay money for these. When you first open it, you\\'ll need to punch out every foam piece.  Then each piece had at least one circle or rectangle that needed to be punched out of it. After about 10 minutes our 6 year old grand son wasn\\'t even half done, even with considerable adult help. He played with the pieces for a few minutes.<br /><br />The directions are very obscure at first glance. And even when spending more time with them it became clear that it wasn\\'t worth trying to figure out which shade of green and which shape went with which dinosaur. Our grand son continued to play with some of the pieces for a few more minutes, but got bored.  Over the next few days, all of the pieces finally got punched out (family effort) but the dinosaurs have never been put together - just too much hassle, and no fun.  Our grand son was content to just play with some of the pieces for a while.<br /><br />The box says this is designed for 6-12 year olds, but even our 10 year old grand son has no interest in putting them together (yet he LOVES putting together Legos).  Like I said, I wish I could give this a better review but I simply can\\'t.  It\\'s not worth buying at any price, let alone nearly $33 just for foam pieces that rival a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, with almost useless instructions.  By all means, save your money!  I was shocked that our 6 and 10 year old grandsons gave up on it - it looked so promising in the photos and in the write-up.\"\\n\"Terrible. I returned. It was very complicated to  transform, due to directions being horrible.\"\\nThis is NOT a toy for a child.  Someone got this for my 4 yr old grandson for his birthday.  Within 10 minutes both he and an older brother had major welts from it snapping back at them.  It needs to have strong danger warnings on it or be removed from shelves.\\n\"Turns out they weren\\'t real, didn\\'t read close enough.\"\\nDidn\\'t receive Arizona State Sun Devils I got Arkansas state instead.\\nWhen I searched for lunch boxes this came up. I was under the impression that this would fit in a backpack. It is a huge cooler backpack lunch box. I think it was bigger than my 2 1/2 year old. Sent it back.\\n\"Buyer beware! This product is falsely advertised!<br /><br />&#34;Stable 5V USB power supply regardless of source, Charge/Recharge algorithms built into chip&#34;<br /><br />This claim is complete garbage. I bought two directly from Seeedstudio, planning to use them as a UPS for Raspberry Pi projects. I took the above claim to mean this would allow the load to be be powered from a battery and/or external USB power supply. However, it will not work this way. The Lipo Rider Pro will only supply a stable 5V output if the battery is connected. The USB input will only charge the battery, but will not be used if the battery is low or missing. Even worse, it won\\'t recharge using the battery if the load is present. You have to either manually disconnect the load or flip the output switch to off.<br /><br />I learned this the hard way when I connected my Rider to a battery *and* USB input, and then plugged it into my RPi, thinking it should run like that indefinitely and be immune to any minor power outages. Imagine my surprise when I checked it the next day to find the battery dead and RPi turned off...but lights still shining on the Rider because it was still plugged into the wall. At first I thought I miswired it, but my setup matched their wiki\\'s recommendations. Then I thought maybe I just had a bad unit. Since I bought two, I tried the other one and found the same results. Using my multimeter, I confirmed that with it just connected to external USB and no battery, the USB output voltage is only between 1.8-2V, and that there\\'s little charging done when you attach both a battery and load.<br /><br />This board is junk. Avoid like the plague.\"\\nI opened it from the box and started flying it - the first thing I know is that the servo cover on one of the wings broke. Then the next thing - a frame section just broken - and the drop was just about 5 ft! This thing sucks - do not buy it again else you\\'ll end up with a headache and sadness at having wasted money.\\nC3PO had a broken leg at arrival. He was made very cheap. Advise not to buy product.

Very disappointed!!!!\\nThese hardly showed up on our car windows and I returned them right away.\\nBroke right away. Very disappointing.\\n\"Junk Battery, The battery came in today, I was hesitant to even buy it with all of the reports of bad cells but I tried it anyway because of the price..... Bad Idea!<br /><br /> The first attempt at a charge has cell number 1 not able to take a charge over 4.00 volts, cell number 2 will not go over 4.14 volts while cell number 3 was fine at 4.20 volts. This batteries quality makes it a charging fire or crash and fire waiting to happen. Not safe.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went ahead and took a replacement battery to give it a try. I still had cell problems. Cell #1 was 4.20 volts and cells #2 and #3 were topping off at 4.14 volts. I decided to try something. I dropped the amps down to 0.2 and ran it again and after 2 hours gained both weak cells to 4.16, another 2 hours and I had pushed them all to 4.20 volts. After one flight they were equally discharged and all cells charged like they were supposed to at 4.20 volts. If you have weak cells try this to bring life to them. this can be done with old batteries with weak cells as well with a pretty fair success rate.<br /><br />Update on Battery #2 - I am done with these, they are dangerous.<br /><br />I just got to run it out in a field and not just in the back yard so I put a bit of stress on it.... I was just coming in to land at about 11 volts (ish) and it dropped to about 7 +/- volts. Apparently the battery shorts and looses a cell, had I not been on the ground rather than the 400 foot up I was just about a minute before this I would have lost my Hex-rotor. The voltage loss registered via on board telemetry and a battery warning device I added. These things are simply not safe for aerial flight.\"\\nCompletely the wrong size! Not 4mm bullets at all\\n\"I bought this plush in hopes that it was cute and squishy like the picture suggests but when it came in the mail it looked like a disgusting creature. The nose is bright pink and plastic and the &#34;cat&#34; has no mouth sewn on. I bought this hoping for it to be a present and because it is so hard to look at, I had to make another emergency purchase. I don\\'t usually write reviews for amazon orders but this order was so awful I felt obligated as a human being to warn others from buying this thing. I attached a photo and you can be the judge if it looks like the picture.\"\\nThese are very poor quality and break while building.\\nWas missing a coil that holds the battery in place.

We loved the ark, and for now, Ivan was at least learning to put the animals into the ark through any hole they would fit through and enjoyed putting them in with the top off!  He is still too young to put the animals into the ark by fitting them into the correct hole. Before we left to go home, I tried to put Noah and his wife in through the proper openings, AND THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THEY FIT!  I have photos... I would love to have the ark with the proper openings, for Noah and his wife so that when Ivan is old enough to put Noah and his wife into the ark, they will go in!!!<br />Our second disappointment were the missing turtles!\"\\n\"My eight year old daughter had high hopes for what looked like a really cool ball.  Unfortunately, her excitement and enthusiasm deflated almost as fast as the air leaking out of the gaping hole that developed within one hour of opening the box and using it.  There simply isn\\'t anything amazing about this ball.  If it cannot withstand the use of a child, then it\\'s a totally worthless toy.\"\\nBad quality. Impossible to make twisting balloons.not happy.\\n\"Ok so i also did not realize these were tiny balloons. It does say 5\\' in the title but yeah.... They were for my son\\'s birthday and the small size would have been managable only they also did not rise!!! We took them, paid $1/ each to inflate them with helium and they sunk like rocks.

Very dissapointing.\"\\nBroke within 5 minutes of play.\\n\"After sorting through this box, there are only 491 cards total.  Of those, there are 108 different cards.  The other 383 cards are repeats of the 108.  The highest number of repeats I received for one card was 15.  There were several 12, 13, and 14 of one card.  I also didn\\'t receive a super rare card or the 15 rares.  Definitely never buying again.\"\\nBought it for my little cousin because it was banned.

Waste of your money\\n\"UPDATE: The glass has gotten foggy between layers with no way to clean them.  The light began to flicker, so I changed the batteries.  After more flickering, the light quit working.  I opened the battery compartment to discover the new batteries had leaked.  Those batteries were from a name-brand, jumbo package of batteries, and others from the same batch are performing fine in small flashlights, so I believe this magnifier could be defective.  It appears to be snapped together loosely, so neither the layers of glass, nor the battery compartments are sealed.  I needed the higher power of the smaller glass combined with the light.  Both are now dysfunctional, so I downgraded the rating from three stars to one.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: The magnifying glass is decent.  I love the built-in light.  The smaller lens--the most important one--came with some debris inside, between the layers.\"\\nProduct did not contain ants. Ants refused to dig tunnels and instead sought to escape.\\nI ordered this and the puzzles 2 of the 4 puzzles I received were NOT what was pictured on my order. The 2 were ones I already had and wanted the ones pictured.

I don\\'t know if it was us or not but it didn\\'t really slush anything.\\nThis product is either falsely or incorrectly advertised as having two way charging capabilities.  It came with NO instructions.  There is absolutely NO WAY this battery would fit into or be charged in the AR drone 2.0 charger.  It does not fit snugly into the AR drone battery compartment either.  If I didn\\'t happen to have a balancing charger from my RC helicopter I would have had no way to charge this thing.  No only am I disgusted with Geekria  but I am also disappointed with Amazon.  Now I have to go through the hassle of packing this up and sending it back.  What a time waster.  Update 09/03/2015.  I also discovered that the battery would loose power suddenly even though the indicator on my I Pad showed power left to land it adequately.

And yet, I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The description says you can receive 4-6 duplicates of a card.  I knew full well to expect more than that, but I was not prepared for what I received.  I\\'ve read reviews on many of the &#34;lots&#34; for sale and have been skeptical.  This one received good reviews so I decided to give it a shot.  For around $40 dollars I figured how bad can it be if you\\'re receiving 2,000+ cards.  Well if I had the opportunity to do it over again I would hesitate before I spent $5 on this.  Why?  Because here is an example of what I received:<br /><br />98 - Chorus of the Tides<br />97 - Revoke Existence<br />97 - Rise to the Challenge<br />90 - Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass<br />89 - Eye Gouge<br />89 - Snake of the Golden Grove<br />87 - Grisly Transformation<br />82 - Claim of Erebos<br />71 - Ephara\\'s Radiance<br />68 - Akroan Skyguard<br />65 - Griffin Dreamfinder<br />63 - Elite Skirmisher<br />57 - Excoriate<br />55 - Culling Mark<br />54 - Sphinx\\'s Disciple<br />53 - Epiphany Storm<br /><br />That\\'s only the cards I received that have over 50 duplicates of the same card.  I listed only 16 cards yet that made up 1,200 of the cards I received!!!  The list continues with a ton of cards that I received 20\\'s, 30\\'s and 40\\'s of duplicates.<br /><br />Again, I had low expectations and knew I would receive duplicates, but this is ridiculous.  PLEASE save your money.  This is definitely not worth it.\"\\nVery small for price same one toys r us 15 bucks\\nLooks cheap! Don\\'t waste your money. Skirt is not as full as it looks in the picture\\nBack on off swich broke off ater about a week of use. Had to theow it away. Waste of money\\nNot what I wanted. Ridiculously big. I can\\'t do any thing with it. Still in the box. Waist of money.<br />What do you do with that? where do you put that to play?\\n\"This is a total waste of time and money. Very cheaply made, the legs do not even match up at the holes to be able to completely screw in the screws. The material the center is made of sags to the floor without my baby even standing on it, and even if it didn\\'t sag the material has zero bounce to it. I have put in a request to return. Very very disappointed. If I could select 0 stars I would.\"\\nThis thing made 6 miniature candy bars for $6. It\\'s a ridiculous amount of money for that. Buy a bag of candy instead.\\n\\'nuff said 😒\\n\"The lower section keep deflating after 1/2 hour not seeing where the leak is taking place i think its the valve, but for me this pool need inprovement at the base tubing.\"\\nIt did not work it wouldn\\'t sing\\nFake China Bullets DANGEROUS BECAUSE TOO HARD. NOT REAL NERF BULLETS<br />Several kids hurt\\n\"The products port for charging is very flimsy.  I had to have the plug put in on an angle in order for it to charge.  By the 4th or 5th time, it would no longer charge.  To make matters worse, Worgo initially stated that they have seen this issue before and if their recommendations didn\\'t work, they would issue a refund.  Once outside the 30 days though, they just pointed over to Amazon and said I\\'d have to work with them.  Very disappointing.\"\\n\"More plastic to the landfill. My daughter got this for her birthday. We tried it once. The whole process was a total pain. Any kid with enough dexterity to use this set could easily use real kitchen tools and not a plastic toy, so I really don\\'t get the point of this product. The pressed shapes looked vaguely like they were supposed to until you try to put the stick in them. Then most of them crumbled or just slid down the stick. The best of them looked like balls we could have simply rolled out by hand. All that plastic is SO unnecessary. And as there are no recipes included with this product you\\'ve got to invest more time and energy in figuring out what to make the cake and frosting out of before you can even begin.\"\\n\"I had such high hopes for this product having had no problems with leappad 2, which still works some years into use, but I wanted a toy with wifi capabilities). However, when I first bought this product, after capturing one of the imagicards less than a month of use, the screen froze and none of the buttons worked including the power button. I ordered a replacement against my first instinct to request a full refund, because my daughter had been looking forward to this toy for some time, and thoroughly enjoys the various apps that I purchased to go along with the leappad platinum. To my dismay, and much to the disappointment of my toddler, the same thing happened to the replacement toy: A FROZEN SCREEN. I am now contemplating that either the platinum edition needs a full review by the manufacturer, or perhaps I received a refurbished rather than a brand new product as was my intent to purchase.\"\\n\"This doll doesn\\'t match the other Disney Ariel dolls we have. Different hair color, different colored eyes, and different skin tone.<br /><br />Arrives in a plastic bag - not standard packaging.\"\\n\"Ordered this for my son\\'s 9th birthday.  It looked cool, but was not functional.  The wand becomes an attachment to the tail and won\\'t stay on.  The figure does not even stand up on it\\'s own once transformed to the dinosaur, which is frustrating.  The instructions were difficult to follow and it was difficult to transform.  We have decided to return it.\"\\n\"The PRODUCT, doesn\\'t contain enough paint in order to complete, the sole reason for a poor review. Had to purchase an entire new kit in order to finish. I think that makes this a poor product, amazon.\"\\nLovely doll but earring is stuck on hair. Will have to open and it will loose it\\'s value\\n\"We are disappointed in this purchase. The tail keeps falling off. It has a wire that attaches the tail to the body. It is difficult to stuff the wire back into the body and keep the tail on. It makes some noise and walks a little, but not worth the money.\"\\n\"Expensive for what was in essence, just bubble solution\"\\n\"Legs do not attach to fly. They just fall out. Very lousy construction, or else there are no instructions on how to assemble properly.\"\\n\"An absolutely awful product.  I love so many things by Battat, but not this one.  This tent is awkwardly shaped, small and is IMPOSSIBLE to fold back once it is unfolded.  I am not kidding you.  I bought this at our local Barnes and Noble and had to take it back unfolded because I could not fold it to save my life!  You\\'d get a third degree sunburn by the time you are done folding it if you take it to the beach!  I urge you to stay away from it and look elsewhere for a better, user-friendly design.\"\\nPain to put together\\n\"Sad to say I\\'m pretty disappointed in this cube. The movement is fairly smooth... most of the time. Within one solve, I could hear springs, and it started to lock up. Maybe I just got a bad one? The colors are very difficult to tell apart unless in very bright light. I opened the curtains, turned on all the lights, and that was the only way it was easy. The cube itself feels like it\\'s made of nothing, a little too light as it feels incredibly flimsy. I worried I was going to break it.<br /><br />The smaller cube is nearly impossible to move. I couldn\\'t do a single solve. It took me 5 minutes to twist it up, and 3 minutes to solve one face when I finally gave up. It feels like 3D printed plastic that wasn\\'t sanded down, and the red and orange look identical to me.<br /><br />The velvet bag though is very nice. Shame that\\'s not what matters.\"\\n\"Like other reviews, the size of this hat should be stated!  It is fitted for a child.  It does stretch but not enough for an average size adult head-so when an adult wears it, the cap will slide off.  And the material smelled strange when I opened the bag---it is from China.  The material is poorly crafted--it\\'s not really a cotton but not a polyester either.  It still smells after washing!  Look for other options if you are looking for a music hat :(\"\\n\"Despite its likeness this item was extremely small and not worth the money.

He is 8 years old and has great attention to detail. I have had to help him with every step. It won\\'t stay together, the pieces don\\'t connect well, and the map/directions are awful. I feel horrible that I bought this for him as he is really sad about the struggles he is having and he doesn\\'t want to finish it cause it won\\'t stay together.

There is a picture of something that starts with that letter. Basically the kid has to be able to read to do this puzzle and recognize oh that\\'s an apple it starts with an A.

It worked fine at the beginning, but there have been multiple connecting problems. one Day, my son used it and after that he charged it like any other boat. after one or two hours it started burning and the hull melted. It nearly burned our house down. The counter that is damaged because of the burns needs to be replaced and is a damage worth thousands of dollars. It could have ended much worse. I wouldn\\'t buy this item. It is made of many cheap items. Also the connecting problems that other people had are nothing what you can do much about. You can only check the to metal pins at the bottom of the boat, but else there is just luck.\"\\n\"The package arrived today. I was excited to open it and thought that I found what I can bring with me for my toddler to keep him busy when we travel this September. When I opened it, the whole item was sticky and oily. It was dirty with some black sticky marks around the frame. I tested out the eraser magnetic swipe and it fell off right off the item. Wow....I am very disappointed. I have to look for another item that will not come damage or might as well go to a store and search for a better one. Will be returning it. It wasn\\'t worth the order.\"\\ndoes not match up with Ipad and constantly loses connection\\n\"Package was 4 days late, which was the fault of Fed ex and not the seller. When the batteries arrived one had a wire pulled out, and two others do not charge to rated capacity. My 500mah batteries last at least 30% longer. Also, the product add states that it works with the UDI 817 which is false. These batteries have an entirely different connection and do not fit in the battery compartment.\"\\nDid not meet expectations and was returned for refund.  A remote controlled car means controlled remotely\\n\"Received as a gift for my son from a friend who purchased this on Amazon. The set was obviously used and had a ton of problems. Some parts were covered in mold,  battery cover was broken on the remote,  no smoke,  remote had a range of about 2 feet, missing instructions,  etc. Not sure if it\\'s a manufacturer or a seller issue,  but I would avoid at all cost, especially considering it\\'s meant for little kids.\"\\nThese are the worst quality kites I have ever purchased. A total waste of money. Thin plastic - worse than a plastic bag. Do not purchase these. I had these kites when I was young but they are not made well anymore.

One star is way too generous.  Please send refund.\\n\"I was excited about this toy, but was disappointed because it is really hard to see the effect of the magnetic stylus.  You &#34;draw&#34; the letters by moving the stylus along the letter outline, and the magnet pulls a little silver pellet up to be flush with the surface of the board.  The holes are sort of shadowy when there\\'s no pellet pulled up, and when the pellet is up, it also is dark.  The change between pellets and no pellets is not visible enough. Also, not all of the pellets stay in place. If a few fall back into the holes, you have to retrace, which defeats the purpose of the activity. You want your child to learn to form the letters correctly, not just to poke around to fix the spots where the pellets fell down. Retracing also causes other pellets to shift, and you really can\\'t successfully make any letter.\"\\n\"If it were bigger, we\\'d have no complaint. It really is super mini in size.\"\\nto small\\n\"The one I bought will not expand beyond 3 clicks.

The camera/video has no instructions for computer download, and does not appear to be compatible with Windows 10. I hope I get my money back.\"\\nThis toy is made for pools not for tubs.  It did not work to my expectation.  It is slow and makes a lot of noise\\ntook a long time to get this together and a part. A waste of time and money. very cheap material.\\n\"Very disappointed in these, my granddaughter who loves Frozen wouldn\\'t even play with these, as the clothes would not stay on and a lot of the small things broke as we try to take them apart off the sheet. She is 4. Not even worth sending back. Never again will I order these waste of money and my reward points.\"\\nCute materials but be warned this bag is HUGE! I have two Mainecoon cats and I swear they could both fit in this bag! More of an overnight bag. Put it this way...if an oriental woman carried it she\\'d tip over!\\n\"I hate it.  It arrived defective as the fiber optic strand holder does not even go into the base of this item.  I requested a refund for this $3.70 item and they want me to take a picture of it as well as the mailing label and send it to them so they can best figure a solution to my problem.  Really?

It came nicely packaged with the battery tab in. I pulled out the battery tab and hit the on button to activate the device and noticed that nothing was happening. No light was coming from the tiny leds. I contacted service which was very understanding and willing to send me another one free of charge. When the replacement arrived, I pulled the battery tab and it appeared that I was having the same problem. I turned off all the lights and looked at the product under a blanket and could see the faintest light coming from 3 of the led lights. I didn\\'t bother contacting support again, but basically this was a waste of money and I didn\\'t end up using it.\"\\n\"My kid loved the toy, but it took 5 weeks to get to me. Ridiculous.

The product obviously did not look new and the box containing the action figure was heavily damaged. This is false advertising and I am unsatisfied with my product that I was supposed to give as a gift. The Goku figure itself did not look damaged but the item was not new as stated.\"\\nProduct did not work when my son tried to use it. It was a Christmas present.

My 7 year old loves Transformers and plays with them all the time.

They were in the kiddie pool for three days & you can see the attached picture of how they looked.<br /><br />On day two I took a handful out and used tap water that has a filter on it and left it overnight and the 2nd picture shows they still did not grow there.<br /><br />Very disappointed.\"\\nOnly works if you have the exact length available to your swing set and the set will not stay together unless mounted.

I\\'m very disappointed!\\nIts nice but small\\n\"Quite simply, the suction cups did not stick to our wall for more than five minutes. I would expect this from a two-dollar version of this product, not the 14-dollar version. I was very disappointed with this item.\"\\n\"Tiny, chintzy, cheaply made plastic toy that would drive you bonkers if you had the collection because you\\'d have pieces everywhere.  The legs on the doll dangle, but that\\'s pretty much the extent of it.  When I first gave this  5-year old Livi, she was excited.  About two minutes after the plastic was off, she was bored.  Her 6-year old cousin came over and fiddled with it a little, then dropped it, too.  It looks like something you\\'d get from a McDonalds kids\\' meal. It took no time at all for Livi to scatter the little pieces.  Lost the thumb-nail sized purple elephant in about 5 minutes. Then I had the idea of putting it in a little make up bag for when riding in a car. Well then she lost some piece within 2 minutes and I wouldn\\'t let her take her seatbelt off to look for it until we arrived at our destination. Even then, she lost interest very quickly with it. This isn\\'t something anyone should spend over 50 cents on. When I threw the package away, I then noticed it was from China. Yuk, so now mom doesn\\'t like it either.\"\\n\"I wish I would have read the reviews on this before purchasing. It is so cheaply made it\\'s not even funny. The back doors don\\'t latch, so when you pull it, the bed comes flying out. The handle to pull is always popping out of it\\'s socket. The hinges on the fold out bed part are constantly coming undone. Great concept, just very poorly executed.\"\\nVery cheaply made. Some dots are off\\n\"Cheap, plastic dinosaur that will give you endless problems. The dinosaur\\'s walking is very temperamental- you have to have exactly the right surface otherwise he moonwalks in place, roaring constantly. Wouldn\\'t suggest it for a 5 year old boy, it wasn\\'t long before he plucked the eyes out and tore the arms off. The tail broke on its own accord revealing eggshell thin plastic with lead weights- I think this was an attempt to give the toy some heft and the illusion of build quality.\"\\nThe window keeps coming off. And the little fish that comes with this and some of the other octonaut toys is severe choking hazard and needs to be removed from the market. I always throw them right away.\\n\"The shipping was the best part about it. Even though it did take over a month, it was in the time it said it would get here. It is very flimsy plastic, the \\'side\\' pieces fall out. I tried to tighten the screw(Yeah it only had one screw), and the screw got torn up.\"\\n\"I would never recommend this product for kids.  My son was holding the stuff and it got into contact with his shirt, I had to throw out his shirt because it would not come off, sticks to EVERYTHING it comes into contact with and for what they charge $10 for a little thing of it with plastic arms and eyes and legs, definitely not worth it, buy it if you want a headache trying to get it off of everything.

Advertized original list price of $55 (in what imaginary land?), and now for $15.95, so I thought it was a bargain, but I was fooled. The box is tiny and feather weight, like a midget boxer, only 79 measly pieces. It sold for $11.95 on elsewhere with free shipping. Too much hassle to return it. Definitely be warned that this is a tiny box and can be completed in under 10 minutes flat with time to spare. Notice how the picture shown does not display the back (or front, depending which way you are viewing it) of the box which tells you how many pieces of Lego there are in the box? that should have been a tip off for me, but it was a late night bleary-eyed purchase, never again.

If you look closely at the picture you can see the blocks are all peculiar shapes with sloping edges. Looks great if you arrange them exactly as shown in the illustration, but it\\'s extremely difficult to create anything else (I struggled and lost patience with them quickly too) so as an imagination-inspiring toy I have to say they\\'re pretty useless.

Here is my story.  Bike arrived, front cable kept twisting around front bolt, had to be replaced.  Took over a month to get the parts and have it repaired.  I did not have to pay for repair.  Next, the bike stopped working when I was about 2 miles from home and I had to literally walk it home.  The problem with with the ignition.  Customer support said it was from &#34;abuse&#34;.  It was repaired, cost me $175.00.  There\\'s more.  The spoke covers became loose and punctured the tire.  $149.00 to have someone change the tire.  The next day, I took it out and did not even get out of my driveway, because the cable on the changed tire twisted around the bolt (just like the original problem).  I am looking for an alternative and I am sick that I spent so much money on it to begin with, but I can\\'t continue to throw money at it.\"\\nLeaked air and went flat the first day.

I wish a company like Fantasy Flight Games or Z-Man games would get the rights to Catan.  This &#34;traveller&#34; edition is a big step backward from the prior edition.  The &#34;variable&#34; board setup is really just six large sections that you fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.  Although the sections are reversible, the numbers printed on the hexes are NOT variable.  There is also no practical way to store these pieces.  The instructions tell you to just stack them on one side of the folding case and then close.  This is easier said than done, but the real problem is that the &#34;hinge&#34; for the case is just some cheap clear plastic strips.  Even if I had confidence that these strips would not break (which I don\\'t), the game pieces protrude through the gaps exposing their edges to potential damage.  In other words, the only way to protect your game from damage or dust is to transport it in the box.  I can package a regular Catan game in a ziploc and take up less room than this monstrosity.  I can\\'t believe I sold my older version to wait for this one.  Catan is a great game, but I would stay away from this version.\"\\nnot what I wanted for the family\\n\"Flat, barely fuzzy circle on 3 inches of elastic.

What kind of message is being sent to 5 year olds about the way they need to look and act? This doll has a look that is sensual, certainly not something I would want my young girl to play with.\"\\n\"Looks good, but worthless otherwise. Sand will not come out of funnel until it is way too wet...then it will pour out like water. Good luck making a dribble castle with this. Kids threw this to the side instantly and played with better toys\"\\n\"We originally ordered this from here and it didn\\'t work at all when we received it. We ordered another of the same bus from another place, it worked great for a day and a half, then was already on it\\'s last leg (even after battery replacement...it\\'s not a battery issue for sure). My son loved it for that one day, now it struggles to go straight and won\\'t move at all if you try to turn it and he\\'s very sad. Definitely a waste of money.\"\\nCame broken\\nBaby doesn\\'t sit up right in this.  Don\\'t worry about cuteness when buying a pool float.

I tried reattaching them but that was extremely difficult and they still didn\\'t work. Those that did stay filled would not pop. We threw them very hard at concrete and they still bounced back, not popping. They were definitely not popping on the kids during the water balloon fight we bought them for.\"\\nInstructions and product were crap\\n\"Spent an hour trying to program it, functionality doesn\\'t match instructions.<br /><br />When you get to the LVC menu, you push a button and listen to beeps.

It sat for a month I tried again going through the step by step instructions..nothing. Months later I had my mom, who has a sewing machine, to try to see if it\\'ll work for her and nothing... its now August, four more months and its Christmas again. I brought fabrics and other accessories and she has yet to use any of it. :(\"\\nWaste!! I followed the instructions.

We couldn\\'t get out handprints in it and it was so lumpy since we were suppose to &#34;add a little at a time&#34; while mixing.\\n\"This chess set is a very bad idea.  The Battle of Gettysburg\\'s sesquicentennial was in July, 2013; consequently many Civil War Chess sets were renamed for the Battle of Gettysburg.  How can I be so sure, simple.  The Union bishops look like General U. S. Grant.  Unfortunately for anyone who buys or sells these sets, Grant was nowhere near Gettysburg.  He was mopping up his greatest victory to date at Vicksburg which resulted in his promotion to Commander of the Union Army of the Potomac.  The actual Union Commander at Gettysburg was George Gordon Meade, a.k.a. Old Snapping Turtle.  None of the pieces look like him.  The Union King does not even look like President Lincoln.  Grant still had black hair in 1863, Lee did not.  However, the artists switched the colors.  The queens do not bear any resemblance to their Historical personages, Mary Todd Lincoln or Mary Custis Lee. The knights should have been easy because their personages were distinctive.  The Union cavalry commander was John Buford Jr., who only had a moustache, not usual full beard, and the CSA cavalry commander was J.E.B. Stuart, who\\'s trademark long thick black beard was easily recognizable.  The mark was missed by miles.  In the final analysis, the makers of these sets took stock figures, faked it, and hoped that the purchasers would be too stupid to know the difference.  After all, anyone who knows anything about chess KNOWS that the whole concept of Historical Chess Sets is simply ludicrous.  The only people who spend hundreds of dollars on a chess sets are purchasing them for serious players, and serious players use the Staunton Design that was set down in the nineteenth century.\"\\ndoesn\\'t work very good\\n\"Very disappointed with this sand table. With any rain, water pours into this. Even with a tarp on top, water still gets in. Sand is well past &#34;moist&#34; and water fills the remainder of the space in the table.

It\\'s poorly made, poorly programmed, way too loud even on the quietest setting, and the voice is creepy and weird. We all hate this one.\"\\n\"Very difficult to put together, nothing is labeled. A consumer must take it apart to build another house. Would never buy again.\"\\nIn my time I have been forced to play some truly terrible children\\'s games.

Your kids will have more fun and so will you.\\n\"My daughter wanted these for favors for her brother\\'s race car bday party. She was so disappointed. They were a mess - smeared paint, missing paint, peeling plastic.

There were no instructions with or in the package or in the seller description. I came to find out there is a metal ball bearing under the canopy with different positions to place the bearing for different flight results. I had to find this out on youtube, so in taking off the canopy it would not come off without distorting the canopy and rubbing off some of the black paint. Mine had glue in the seam toward the canopy which is why it was so difficult. I haven\\'t taken it out after being able to move the canopy and change weight distributions and perhaps it will fly well. The reason for my poor review is because this product is sold without instructions and also due to the canopy being such a huge pain in the neck. I\\'m an adult and I have no idea how a kid would be able to use this item without some major help.\"\\nDon\\'t let your kids try to climb on top of it. Not for kids under 4.\\nYou would expect them to stay filled in time to at least have balloon war but unless you act immediately you will only see a few left filled.  Very disappointing.

Also, would have much preferred being able to choose the figurine I wanted but really if the figurine looks like I painted it not really worth it anyway.\"\\n\"Honestly, false advertising here!  This thing is the size of a gnat and will not stay in an upright position thus making it useless to play with.  It is a ring toss game for heaven\\'s sake which requires it to stay setting straight up in the water.  This poor thing list to port like a drunken sailor after  3 day leave.  Absolutely useless!

The says 800 on it but I was supposed to get 1000 cards.\\n\"I bought this replacement engine for an older truck after it\\'s engine went and it seemed like a great deal.  I followed all instructions while setting it up and ended up severely disappointed.<br /><br />After installing it in the truck, the pull starter broke before getting the engine to start for the first time. I ordered a replacement spinstart to fix it, which also broke from how much the engine stalled during break in. I put a third starter in, and once I tried to start it, the one way bearing cracked and broke imeediately.<br /><br />I was barely able to break this engine in and never even gotten to the point where I could drive it around the block. I\\'ve completely given up and regret getting this.\"\\n\"Very cute, great idea but broke the same day we got it. The way it\\'s made it will not stand up on its own that good and If u plan on moving it from room to room it will not last at all. Microphone was the first thing to break, it played at a decent volume but the place to hold your device will only fit small cell phones or iPods, tablets definitely will not fit. I bought this for a 2 year old.\"\\n\"I bought three of these,  one at a time, from Amazon.  Every one of  them was broken and I had to return them.

Upon opening the packaging, a noxious chemical smell became very evident.  The smell was overpowering and not only gave me a headache, but made me nauseous.  My husband and children all noticed and commented on the smell from across the room.  I don\\'t know what possessed my husband to actually put his lips on this piece of toxic waste to blow it up, but after inflating, the paint began peeling off the turtle\\'s face.  No one could handle the smell any longer and the ball was put outside to air out.  Unfortunately, the chemical smell lingered on the skin of everyone who touched it.  The product still smelled hours later, so I attempted to wash the ball in warm soapy water, to no avail.  Despite following the inflation instructions on the packaging, the ball split open a few hours later and became a smelly piece of junk.  Believing this to be a fluke, we picked up another ball from Target.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same issue with regard to the noxious odor.  I contacted the company, which was surprised to hear my comments, as no similiar complaints have ever been reported after selling millions of these balls.  I then began looking up reviews of Imperial\\'s bop balls.  While a very limited number of reviews can be found for these balls, 3 of the 5 I did find highlighted the chemical smell, while the other 2 discussed the poor quality.  I also found 2 Youtube reviews commenting on the terrible smell and poor quality.  I would never purchase a similar item from this company again, no matter how cute they look.\"\\nThis water is good...<br /><br />FOR NOTHING that\\'s all I have to say\\nHuge disappointment. The markers write so lightly that you can hardly see the marks. My son looses interest almost instantly not being able to see his scribbles. I replaced the markers and it was no better.\\nThese don\\'t last. Don\\'t get these if you can\\'t have nice things. Stupid.\\n\"We like it a tiny bit but don\\'t because it is not what is described. First it is very small. Smaller than described. It is NOT a plush as described. It is a wire doll of Jack with a tiny bit of stuffing. A plush doll to me, is a stuffed animal/doll type without thick wire in it.  This isn\\'t cuddly or something to play with for a child. It is more of a wire figure and able to pose him anyway with the wire.  Only thing plush about him, is his tiny head. I would have sent back if it wasn\\'t such a hassle to do.\"\\n\"My son loved this toy at daycare but broke his arm because it got stuck between the bar and the tire when he was jumping down from it.  The product\\'s website claims to have no reported injuries.  I understand that accidents happen, but I think there needs to be more honesty about the potential for injury.\"\\nDidn\\'t sling very well and the pig sound  was way off.  I was too embarrassed  to give to  the person I ordered it for.\\nPeople are miss using this peace of s*** card if they think it works against a plainswalker. By definition a plains walker is not a creature so this card is useless and shouldn\\'t go above $7 so thanks so much for raising the price on an offal card.\\n\"I will never order from here again. My son is 4 and i wanted this for him to make learning his letters fun. Well we waited for it to come in ,and it did . The box was damaged , some letters where damaged, 2 wheels were broken. There is glue everywhere like it was put together at someones house very quickly. I know $10 is not a lot but I thought it would have been better made. Now my son is disappointed because he loves trains , so I am trying to fix it to put a smile on his face.\"\\nFalse advertised. Advertiser claims ring is magnetic. False. Also ring size is way to small to fit an average hand.\\n\"Boots are cute, but there were drops of glue in several places on one boot ruining the look.\"\\n\"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! it is a waste of money and it\\'s made out of really cheap material not even close to the asking price.

Bought one for my 9-year-old daughter for her birthday.  It popped on the second day.  (She was sitting on it, which she had seen them doing on the commercial.)  I sent the valve and a check for $6.99 to the company, and six-plus weeks later, I got a replacement.  A week later, it popped again, even though this time she was only holding it while watching TV and we had it inflated much less than the maximum, which is suggested to keep from popping.<br /><br />The commercials sell little kids on how fun a toy this is, and then it just makes them cry when it inevitably pops.  She just said to me, &#34;You can\\'t trust anything they say on TV.&#34;  True, but a harsh lesson to learn at the age of 9.\"\\nThe first time I went to install this on the lens it simply crumbled into pieces.

Terrible odor is present from the cheap paint used on the figure.<br /><br />3. Colors are inconsistent through out the figure with patches of darkened or light especially on skin and details such as nail polish or the figure\\'s eyes are painted sloppy.<br /><br />4. The parts such as accessories or (body parts) for the figure to hold doesn\\'t fit or stay in place.<br /><br />5. Material is cheap and flimsy and breaks easy and sometimes the figure comes broken already and filthy stains and dirt on the figure as if they just took it out of the mold and wrap it up with bubble wrap on the assembly line.<br /><br />6. The figure comes wrapped in a bubble wrap or in a brown cardboard box (usually with no instructions booklets etc.) instead of a window box decorated with pics of the figure and company/manufacturer\\'s logo.<br /><br />7. If the figure did come in a window box, it\\'s riddled with english that makes no sense (a.k.a. jibberish with random words jumbled together with miss spellings).<br /><br />8. The figure is advertized on Amazon with vague discriptions like.. (i.e. sexy girl anime, hot figure girly, or something besides the figure\\'s real title or name.)<br /><br />9. I started to notice the ppl that sells these knockoffs even writes fake positive reviews to lure ppl into buying the cheap knockoffs. You can spot the fake reviews by reading them because it seems as though it\\'s been written by non english speaking ppl.<br /><br />10. The figure is sold/manufactured by unknown company, and the origin of the figure is usually China. I have seen some from (Hongkong) before.<br /><br />11. Knockoff figures they are advertizing isn\\'t represented by a known company instead most of the time it\\'s a person (i.e. Nuoya001, Qiyun or some username type)<br /><br />12. These in my opinion (95% sure) are distributors/sellers of fake anime figures and statues. (Nuoya001, Qiyun, seven weapon, seller tycoon, LUCKSTAR,) and more but can\\'t list them all because they keep changing their names, most likely to avoid angry customers? I don\\'t know...<br /><br />Remember: The japanese companies (Max factory, Megahouse, Yamato, Orchid seed, Good smile, Kotobukiya) and others that makes the authentic figures, they are &#34;made in China&#34; because they have their own factories there supervised by the japanese companies and (sculptors of the figures). Which means that not everything comes out of China is a knockoff. Research the anime figure companies and beware of fakes.

It is flimsy and not the high quality I am used to for Little Tykes products.  As other negative reviews state the slide is lightweight and the bottom pops up when the child climbs the ladder.  Also it seems like it could easily tip over when the child tries to maneuver himself to sit down on the top.  I could not let my grandson play with this unless I stood right by to &#34;spot&#34; him.

The tiny little plastic pieces that secure the tiny little bars to the plastic are difficult to get at without also chancing cutting through the toy itself.<br /><br />2. Installing the battery through the cage is a bit of a pain. More so when you figure you will have to do it often. Not sure how long the wiring will last with constant removal. See #3<br /><br />3. The battery life is terrible. You get 10-15 minutes of play time between charges. If you or your child has a short attention span that may be fine but that doesn\\'t work for us.<br /><br />4. The controller is cheaply made. Three of the buttons on the left hand side feel like they are about to cave in and they were like that straight out of the package.<br /><br />5. Stand? What stand? The instructions say you must place the High Roller on it\\'s included stand but there is none in the box...<br /><br />6. The High Roller is enclosed in a cage for protected flying but this does not prevent the propellers from flying off. One red one snapped in half within the first 5 minutes of playing and the other red one just flew off. When the propeller breaks you don\\'t just have to find the propeller but also the tiny, little metal piece that goes with it. Good luck with that. One of the red propellers will not stay on no matter what we do which means stopping every one to two minutes to fix it. It doesn\\'t even have to hit anything before it flies off...<br /><br />Bottom line: I really wanted to like this. It sounded fabulous and I was looking forward to receiving it. Unfortunately it has many more negatives than positives. IF the above problems were fixed I think it would be an amazing toy to play with and perfect for indoor play.\"\\nProduct was missing pieces and the pieces that were there didn\\'t fit properly.\\nbought this two times this summer. both times within a week one side had a leak and went flat. cant float around with half a raft and the other half all sad and deflated. waste of money.\\ntoo large for the motor that was identified on the site.\\nIt\\'s as terrible as everyone says.

What a disappointment!  It takes on water inside the two pontoons, began listing to the right-side, and one of the functions associated with the remote just stopped working after literally one minute in the water.  Might be fun for non-water use, but forget about using this in water.<br /><br />BACKGROUND:  I gave this to my older, pre-teen son to try out.  After charging the battery for the required five hours, we dropped in the battery into vehicle and went outside.  On the ground, it moves side-to-side very quickly, but going forward and backward was ridiculously slow.  Some blades of grass got caught in the rotating pontoons, adversely affecting its forward motion.  But we mostly wanted to try it out in our pool.<br /><br />In the pool, it was an utter disappointment.  On the remote, the right-side button I think angles the pontoons so it moves forward or backward, but after a minute in the water, the vehicle stopped responding to the right-side forward/backward button on the remote.  It was stuck in the forward position, so we were still able to maneuver it in the water okay (tricky, though, as the left-side button is imprecise).  But then the pontoons started filling with water, and the vehicle listed badly to the left, then it nose-dived forward, too.  At this point, it\\'s still useable, but in looking over the battery cover seal, I feared that it would foul the battery compartment, so we took it out of the water.  Even after drying, the right-side button on the remote that controls the forward/backward motion doesn\\'t work correctly on the vehicle.<br /><br />In short, this was a huge disappointment, and for the money that Mattel is asking for to buy this thing, I\\'d be furious if this weren\\'t a review sample.  My son has since tossed it to the side, unable to use it in the pool.  Maybe we\\'ll bring it indoors, but the outdoor experience was so bad, it immediately lost its appeal with my son (and with me).<br /><br />WHAT WE ALSO DID NOT LIKE:<br /><br />- The remote control is super-chintzy, light, and not at all like a nice gaming console control<br />- The two buttons on the remote have terrible tactile feel, imprecise and cheap-feeling<br />- Although this is supposed to be used in water, the vehicle\\'s pontoons take in water and cause the vehicle to list if they don\\'t take in water at the same rate<br />- The battery compartment doesn\\'t have a gasket to keep water out of it; it\\'s just a plastic cover screwed onto a plastic body<br />- The fine-printed instructions give important information that should be much more prominently communicated, like, don\\'t recharge a hot battery, wait about 10 minutes, or else you\\'ll damage the battery\\'s future charging capacity, and charge the battery for 5 hours for the first two charging cycles<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  Save your money and buy your kid some Legos or a cheap quad-copter instead.

The idea that I could get my girls something that wasn\\'t all about princesses and how they looked completely appealed to me.  My oldest was very excited to play with it--yay!  That was the point!  Then she followed the directions to build things and it all went downhill from there.  Nothing stays together.  She will build something and as soon as she tries it out, it falls apart, rendering her frustrated and upset that her hard work was done in vain.  At first I thought maybe she just wasn\\'t getting the pieces put in tightly enough so I tried it.  It fell apart for me too.<br /><br />She seems to forget how frustrating this toy is and pulls it out once in a while (like just now, which prompted me to write this).  She was so proud that she build a &#34;robot&#34; and once she got it to me to show it off, it just fell apart again.  She didn\\'t throw it or handle it badly.  She gently put it on the table next to me, while still holding it, and pieces flew everywhere.<br /><br />Bottom line, don\\'t waste your money.

One piece of chalk was barely enough to write &#34;Mom&#34; on our smooth driveway.  The pieces completely fell apart during use and left a sopping mess.  Chalk never glowed.

He would really like it, except that the Velcro is so strong that he cannot pull the pieces apart once they are stuck together. I have had to &#34;chop&#34; between the pieces repeatedly with the spatula to get them separated.  Also the hard plastic it is made from (not rubbery like some I\\'ve seen) is so thin and brittle, that the plastic has actually cracked and broken before the Velcro would separate.  It was cheap, but not worth the money in my book.  Find one that will actually have real play value.

If this worked flawlessly I would have no problem rating it much higher, but due to my issues, and the fact that there are other people with the same exact problem, I am just requesting my money back. Save your money and get something that will last longer than 10 minutes. The price is too much to not have it work flawlessly.<br /><br />Another thing.

She wouldn\\'t play with them by herself and asked me over and over to help her make the characters on the box. After a very sad attempt to make the green vampire, I stuck with trying to make a snake. My little one was more interested in playing with all of the little extras (eyes, hats, mouths etc.) then the actual Bunchems. Like I said, I think this product is better for much older kids.\"\\n\"Junk 2 out of 3 had seams not sealed, threw in trash!\"\\n\"[[ASIN:B0081JSQ2Q Replacement Rotor Assembly for Summer Escapes SFS1000 Filter Pump]]<br /><br />1. Just received the rotor by US (Snail) mail after 10 days.  Ordered the part on 8/1/15.  Amazon said would be delivered by August 6th - 10th. It arrived on 8/11 at my local post office. Needless to say we did not get to go swimming for about two weeks.<br /><br />2. After installing the new rotor, the filter motor ran fine for about 30 minutes then the plastic white tip of the rotor broke to pieces and here we are still with no pool.  Time to close it up.  Not paying for another piece of junk.\"\\nMy dog almost drowned<br /><br /> Very unstable poor quality\\nThe picture is purple. But what came is a red boov. We were disappointed\\nThis is terrible the wheels don\\'t move and one of the back of the wheel came off when we recieved it and I had to glue it back on it was  to much to stand in line at the post office to send it back it\\'s not worth $37.00 dollars!!!\\nThis set is a cheaply made version of another set you can get for $25 from another seller. Feel like I was totally cheated on this purchase.\\nWhen we got 1/3 of the way through the roll they were not cut and stopped coming off.  We needed them for a show so too late to exchange for a new roll. Terrible product.\\n\"The glasses are definitely not mask shaped, they make the game look way better than it actually does when it arrives.  Looks like something I could have got at the dollar store....\"\\nThese are cheap plastic!  Not die-cast metal.\\n\"The new product, which I came, was purchased used, and a little shabby paint detail sound, since I did not like was the purchase of a new product\"\\n\"The problem with this toy is the molding system is flawed. It doesn\\'t allow the two chemicals to mix properly so what happens is after several hours, you have a flimsy case that is still gooey in some areas. We let it sit overnight and the next day it was still gooey. That same thing happened with both tries. It\\'s a good idea but poorly designed.\"\\ndid not work.  couldn\\'t even get screw loose to put in batteries.  waste of money\\nOverpriced!\\nWORST product! I had it less than 24 hours for my 20 month old and had to throw it away. It ripped in two places and the inside bars didn\\'t stay in place. Complete waste of money. I would HIGHLY recommend finding a more durable tent.\\nDid not cover well at all.\\n\"I read every single review and felt confident ordering this product. When I received it, and started packaging my coins, I noticed EVERY SINGLE different size was leaving considerable amounts of white flecks of cardboard all over my coins. I either got a very bad batch, or other folks seem to be ok with this effect. Either way, I am returning the entire lot, and will never buy this product again. I would leave 0 stars, but according to amazon guidelines, I have to choose a star rating:(:(\"\\nThere are. No dimensions of this product in the description<br /> I had to return it. A big hassle!\\nThis is a recast of an Iplehouse doll. It is a COUNTERFEIT. DO NOT BUY.\\n\"Receiving goods and photos are different, and it is bad, the cat\\'s hands don\\'t move, don\\'t want any other buyer cheated, very poor!\"\\n\"Beautiful Sleeve, terrible craftsmanship. I had one duel with these sleeves on and 5 of them instantly had the decal DMG peel apart from the sleeve while 3 others ripped while shuffling. I recommend staying away from this buy. Too expensive if you cant even use the sleeves in confidence!\"\\nDisappointed. Wrong item.\\nReceived these Shopkins yesterday and they are fake!  The colors are wrong and do not match the legit Shopkins figures or checklist.  The painting is sloppy or smeared on some and they have a strong plastic smell.  The package was obviously opened and retaped when we received it.  It looks like the authentic shopkins were taken out and replaced with counterfeit ones.  Very disappointed and upset to be sold cheap knock-offs when it is advertised as real Shopkin Moose products.\\nIt\\'s made very cheap! I had it out not even five minutes and the one piece of pizza cracked. The Velcro pulled from the pizza and made a hole too! Don\\'t get this item!!\\nWaste of money!\\nAnother item I should have just got at the Dollar Store. Very poor quality!\\nReally small for the cost.\\nThe order form says 1:24 size and product received was 1:32 size.  Very disappointing.\\nThese pencils come in beautiful colors. The issue is that the leads are broken in the pencils and when you sharpen them they continually break. I am very disappointed.\\nonly one little figure is not supposed to cost this much.\\n\"If I could give no stars I would.  Not because the product isn\\'t great, but because the sales person(or owner as he implied) is completely offensive. He gave us his sales pitch at our county fair.  When we chose not to buy from him, he became mean. Told us he knew when he started we wouldn\\'t buy. Scowling and getting worse as time went on(one in our party was considering buying the product without him knowing).  Later on we talked to another family who couldn\\'t believe how rude he was.  As a fellow salesperson, I know how to treat people and he was so far off I will never buy this product.\"\\nNOT A DJI PHANTOM 3 EXTENDER! DON\\'T BELIEVE THERE CRAP!\\nBusted the first time we used it. No good.\\nNever flew right\\nMore wheela than actual connection to be compatible with legos my 3 yr was very disappointed he couldn\\'t make a bunch of cars\\n\"Major safety hazard. Do not buy this toy. My son was injured today when the long antenna on the back of this car punctured the underside of his toe. Because of the curly q at the top of the wire, he had to go to urgent care, the wire cut and removed, followed by an X ray to ensure all of the metal was out. He is now on 3 antibiotics. This product is a MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD!\"\\nThe light is not working\\n\"I guess they must have changed the quality because these are junk. Seriously save you $12.  They are poorly painted and not very sturdy. I suspect the magnets will definitely pop out over time. They are just punched in in a hole on the sides. Plus, my purchase came missing a magnet on a boat. Refund needed!  Not so fun if you cannot connect them different wats. They stick together horribly too!  Look for something else.\"\\n\"I\\'d love to give this a better rating, but it only comes with one cone!\"\\nVery cheaply made. Not worth $29\\nHorrible once I saw the code I put the code in and ever since I opened it once it does not shut right. Is by far the worst product I bought on Amazon.\\nBroke in one day\\n\"I purchased this tent for a trip to the beach with my 6 month old. After reading reviews and seeing as it was made for little kids at the beach, I thought, let\\'s buy it!<br /><br />We received it promptly and the next day tried setting it up in the backyard. We didn\\'t even get it set up before the a pole broke. Trying to thread the pole through the loop to stand the tent up was impossible - the pole had no bend, so it snapped.<br /><br />Since this tent was unusable, we bought a Coleman tent for camping to use at the beach. It was bigger, but actually held up.\"\\nSuch a cute perfect beach tent... But day 2 on the beach and taking it apart the cord in the supports broke... This essentially makes the tent not functional. Will see if I can get my money back.\\n\"Cute, but came completely crushed! I\\'m very disappointed especially because this is a collectible and wasn\\'t to even be opened from the box.\"\\n\"This is not blue, at all. It\\'s straight up green. And an ugly green at that. It looks like if blue paper sat in the sunlight for a long time and discolored.\"\\n\"VERY disappointed with this item.  Despite being easily set up, what the manufacturer doesn\\'t state in any advertising is that you need a Bluetooth device, such as iPad, iPhone etc within 30ft to receive all messages.  These messages then have to be physically forwarded to the pet.  Using the device that receives the message can be used to send video messages itself so not sure what the point of the Cloudpet is.\"\\nThis piece is basically useless for its intended purpose. The thumb screw is too small diameter so the hinge can not be tightened. I modified it and used the anti vibration mount for another setup. Couldn\\'t be bothered to return this junk.\\nThey were scratched never been able to use they were so bad.\\nNot worth the $100+ costume. The leve of detail is the same as the ones you can buy for $40. Complete ripoff!\\n\"I am super disappointed. I received about 8 spirit tokens and maybe 10 Goblins. The rest were at a minimum duplicates. Some of them there were as many as 5 of the same card. I only received maybe 6 or 7 different types of tokens out of 50 and not a single one was an elf, which is what I was hoping for.\"\\nFilmsy. Instantly broke when i opened package up\\nTHEY ARE JUNK  HAD 8 BLOW UP BEFORE I COULD FILL THEM HALF WAY UP THE FIRST TIME\\n\"A waste of my money, the thing fell apart. first one of the ears came OFF, then The tail came OFF. The glue came OFF the bottom and it started detaching away from the case.\"\\n\"its VERY inconsistent , poor quality as I\\'ve tested it several times\"\\nMy mother in law bought this for my 1 year old who is 22lbs and it doesn\\'t work. We let it charge for well over 12hours and it won\\'t move with him on it or even when he isn\\'t on it. Returning item.\\nSucker\\nItem arrived with the word LEAKS handwritten in black sharpie across the packaging. Unacceptable as this was supposed to be a gift.\\nWe didn\\'t get one usable water balloon. What a bust!!! My kids were very disappointed. I rarely review things unless it\\'s a five or a one.... this product is a one star.....do not buy it does not work at all.\\nSon in tears over a broken ripper\\nWhen I opened the box one of the rubber treads for the plastic tire was ripped and was not on the wheel. I am not sure who to contact for a replacement.\\nSuper tini tiny pieces and they are not distinctively carved.  We would be embarassed to play with friends using this set. Plus several pieces arrived brokened.\\nThe balloon has been in heated condition as when we open the paint was stuck to each other\\nI\\'ve received the rong one. I had ordered SMA and I received RP-SMA.\\nIt has been quite a long time since I purchased a Ken doll from when I was a child. This doll was disappointing! The face looks EXACTLY like Barbie minus the long hair. This Ken doll is wearing pink lipstick and has the same FULL makeup as Barbie! The head is made of a really soft plastic that you can squeeze with your hand...my toddler already chewed through it in a matter of an hour! Not the Ken doll I was expecting!!\\nDidn\\'t work from the second i got it\\nProduct didn\\'t work. After trying several pairs of known good batteries I could not get it to function. I\\'ve started the replacement process and will update this review once I\\'ve tried the replacement.   Update: The replacement I received did not work as well. I\\'ve since bought a similar product from another seller and it works without issue.\\nDO NOT BUY.. Never again will I. Cheaply made! Not worth the $25 dollars i payed.\\nNot very durable :(\\nI didn\\'t know I was going to receive the sixth part of the product I thought.\\nBox says &#34;800 count&#34; and bunch of copies of the same cards least 9-15. I wouldn\\'t mind if it was three copies but this is a rip off. Least their real cards but not worth the buy.\\nFake!!!!\\nStates 4&#34; dinosaurs the length of them is 2 - 2 1/2&#34; These were supposed to be for a dinosaur dig for my kids\\' birthday party...it\\'ll be like looking for a needle in a haystack :(\\n\"I was really excited to find these .. they were great for about a week, but then one by one they started leaking as the seams began coming apart.  We ordered them to replace hacky sacks for our corn hole game ... they just didn\\'t hold up.\"\\noverpriced\\n\"Alphie is great, and functional, but it has orange paint stains on the face, not good for a gift!! Horrible paint job!!!\"\\n\"I am a consistent puzzler, but this one just frustrates me.  I\\'m going to give it away to someone I really don\\'t like!\"\\n\"I received this pack as part of a promotion from the company. I am not being paid to write this review, though I did get the product for free.<br /><br />First, I\\'ll say that my daughter liked them for a couple hours. She\\'s enjoyed making shapes that don\\'t look like much, but her imagination makes look like penguins, polar bears, and princesses. I play with them with her, and making them stick together to make the things in the instructions doesn\\'t work so well, but really, that doesn\\'t matter too much to a 4 year old. They just want to create. For free play and open creativity, Bunchems are a decent choice.<br /><br />But as any parent will tell you, it\\'s not just about what\\'s fun for your kid. Practicality matters too. Clean up matters. Storage matters. The bottom line is that Bunchems do not come with so much as a plastic bag to store them in. There is no included method for containing these 400 little pieces, and that is a huge turn off. Furthermore, these things get dirty fast. They trap hair, (And get stuck in it), dust, pet hair and pretty much anything else that they touch in their little hooks. For god\\'s sake don\\'t let these near your child\\'s hair. To be fair, there\\'s a warning on the box that says they\\'ll entangle in hair, but honestly, I\\'d have rather removed gum than these.<br /><br />Lastly, they just don\\'t work very well. Making anything from the instructions is nigh impossible. Heck... making anything that looks like an actual thing rather than *heavy imagination required* to make it look like something isn\\'t going to happen. They stick together, but without a lot of extreme precision and exact placement and rotating the little balls to be in just the right spot, I can\\'t imagine anything meaningful being built without spending a few hours on a little owl or monkey.<br /><br />So to recap: For the few hours of fun they provide for your child, these provide a mess with no included storage, they pick up hair, they entangle in hair, and they just plain don\\'t work very well. I don\\'t recommend.n\\'t work very well. I don\\'t recommend.\"\\n\"Not a single iridescent sticker in the lot. Very poor quality paper - super thin. NONE of the types of stickers pictured were shown, and not that they have to be exact but what I received were very juvenile, poor artwork stickers - not die cut all just an image on a round sticker - super boring. Lots of farm animals, &#34;good job reading,&#34; and religious stickers (which not that I mind but for the purpose I need them for that was not appropriate given that it wasn\\'t indicated that there\\'d be ANY words on the pictures.

The sound is so muffled, that I can hardly distinguish what sound it\\'s saying. All of the letter sounds, sound the same. The voice has a British accent, so it confuses my son. He asked me what a &#34;caught&#34; was. It was saying cat! The duck slider at the top doesn\\'t even line up with which function you want to use. The first day we had it, my husband noticed a screw on the floor. One of the screws on the back had come out and was stripped. It wasn\\'t even the battery screw. This was very dangerous since we have a 7month old. I know you get what you pay for, but this is beyond cheap.\"\\nGreat game if it had all the pieces!!!!\\nThese are not JST-XH connectors.  It\\'s not worth it to mail the item back to China.\\nToo flimsy....and you really need a set of 2 to make the game work\\n\"HORRIBLE PRODUCT!

I was expecting a handheld Su Doku game as shown in the image and as referenced by the reviewers, but instead all I got was a PC game!

Since it was meant for a child to use on their own away from a computer especially when travelling, it kind of defeats the purpose. Not satisfied.\"\\nHorrible just horrible the face bolt broke emidialty after I bought it. don\\'t waste your time\\nIt looked like it would have a lot of cards but it came with barely any. I would get something else.\\nmost of them had cartoons for 5 year old kids\\n\"Like the other reviewer, we also bought this item for our niece for her birthday and because of the extra character that was suppose to be included, however, also like the other reviewer, we were disappointed that it was not included! We took a risk in hopes that the previous customer experience was a fluke, but it was not. Including the name of the additional character in the item description and picturing it in the pictures is deceptive and misleading.

I first blew them up by mouth - of the first 20, 3 popped right away. I left the 20 overnight and 5 had deflated (just low quality; the other brands I bought were fine overnight). There is no way I can use these with helium. So, instead, we\\'re just going to scatter them around the house and use a different brand for the helium.<br /><br />The only good thing: They are pearly, shiny colors.\"\\n\"Why does Disney attach their name to such cheap rubbish? The frame is made of cheap plastic tube, which broke in two places before we even got it set up. The Tent has two ties on it which both came off while I was trying to set it up. And the light no longer works ( after owning this for less than a week).   My son had a Lightning McQueen tent years ago that was much higher quality than this junk. Don\\'t waste your money.\"\\n\"Should have paid attention to the 57% 1 STAR RATING!!  I have the V1.0 pen and love it. Was teaching a kids\\' tech art class and wanted a 2nd pen for them to tinker with. The 1.0 still works after a year. I get this 2.0 thinking it will be even better.<br /><br />I read the manual to see what\\'s changed, make sure there\\'s nothing the kids really need to know. Couple of changes and nicer packaging. I happily plug it in, get the ABS Blue light to signal it\\'s ready, I put the filament until it &#34;clicks&#34; (that\\'s new), I wait for 30 seconds (hmm, motor sounds different...), I wait for 2 minutes with it running and nothing happening (uh, lets review the manual...), check everything twice, take the tip off (what in the HELL could be smoking?!), give it a gentle twist as manual recommends, give harder push- NOTHING.<br /><br />Nothing but the strange sound of poorly manufactured product.<br /><br />&#34;Okay kids, this happens sometimes. We got a lemon, I\\'ll call Amazon.&#34; Kids learned all about how nice Amazon customer service is, and Amazon learns of my camp and ships me a replacement with free overnight shipping. Excellent.<br /><br />I get the replacement today and get to REPEAT THE WHOLE PROCESS with a new pen! This time, I\\'m convinced it must be me. I follow the directions to take out the impossible metal clip to see that 3Doodler didn\\'t think a couple things through-<br /><br />1. The motor may not be strong enough for the screw style gripping gear.<br />2. The filament may not be pressed close enough for the screw gear to actually grip.<br />3. The heating element is sporadic in the time it takes to properly heat.<br />4. The internet is full of people who will create detailed reviews if products are not up to par or expectation based on advertisement.<br /><br />So my annoyed little brain starts googling. And my issues appear to be common. They have sold this pen with it\\'s poor quality to others, and then forced them to do things like wait months or createvideos to PROVE it\\'s not just jamming to get a replacement or money back. Thank god I ordered through Amazon and got to skip that mess.<br /><br />I wish there was a button to recommend Amazon no longer sell a product. From the reviews, I say you got a 50/50 shot of getting a 2.0 pen that works properly and would be better off buying a 1.0. I will personally NEVER buy a 3Doodler product again.\"\\nDon\\'t even bother!  The lenses were all busted in shipping and the kids didn\\'t even wear them for two minutes before the bows &/or frame fell apart.\\n\"Didn\\'t want to even give it one star. They do not work.

The magnet hook must be carefully placed in just the right spot of the mouth, and then the hinged mouth does close on it - but that\\'s the end of the fun. They are just more hard-plastic fish-shaped bubbles. I could not find anywhere indicating place of origin or manufacture - I wanted to support an American manufacturer.

I was super excited when I got it.  But when I started to put it together, it confused me.  The little slit things didn\\'t fit between the little walls.  I also had another problem.  The slits came attached so it was impossible to get the slits separate.  I had to literally break my scissors to just get one of the slits.  I am not sure if my case was just badly made or if all of them are like that.<br />If most are not like this, than this case would be awesome.  The main problem is the slits.

My son was very disappointed when I couldn\\'t complete the train for him because one of the wheels missing (the missing part is the inside gray cylinder of the wheel, not the black rubber one).<br />if I need 10 wheels to complete the train then the kit should provide more than 10 wheels just in case. providing exactly the same number needed is nonsense. In this case if one wheel is lost you will end up with a cripple train. (or you find someway to use 8 than 10 wheels which doesn\\'t really make me comfortable).<br />Moreover, they tell you the kit will have hundreds of pieces while you find most of the pieces are microscopic. Small pieces can be put in your fist and you can catch a hundred or more of them. That shouldn\\'t really be considered pieces. They should tell for example that the kit has 10 normal pieces and 400+ microscopic pieces. That should make more sense.<br />I found other brick alternatives that are LEGO compatible and with much less price. I ordered the wheels kit, the roofs kit and a bricks kit with 800 pcs.

I just opened it 10 minutes ago and was checking the parts and found the decals missing. I am not happy about this problem. I\\'m not going to build the plane because I can\\'t finish it. Somebody messed up. I could use another word but I won\\'t.\\nProduct poor material\\nWHHHHHAAAT!!! Im so mad...the ONLY reason i bought this was for Picachu..my 4 year old is really disappointed! FALSE ADVERTISING!\\n\"This product arrived dysfunctional. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I bought 2 different packages of batteries.  It still hasn\\'t worked.  Needless to say, I\\'m fairly angry.  Don\\'t spend your money in this product.\"\\nThis toy was only dollar store quality and did not work that well.  The dish needs to be deeper.  They should put a bigger bottle of bubbles in too!\\nHorrible! No directions. Very little bracelet string. Comes apart\\n\"Hi! The pilot is missing from the airplane and the airplane doesn\\'t work properly. I need to turn it on and off every minute(missing box, instructions...). This toy is in a very bad condition. I wouldn\\'t pay more than $10 for it.\"\\nI received two wings of same side. I am not satisfied with it.\\nHooks are not gray and black. They are all gray which isn\\'t my main complaint. The cup does not stay on the hook. It falls right off. I ordered these for a birthday party and I had to wrap a rubber band around each handle to get the two pieces to stay together. Very disappointing!\\n\"Rips waste of money, I bought 2...\"\\nLike white yarmulkes - there was no stiffening in the brim. They were cheap - which is what attracted me but given their construction - they were not really sailor hats.\\nNo amount of trim balancing would level this thing out to get it to fly right.\\nPrice is completely bonkers wait till it drops back down to under 30...\\nNot even a year old and I\\'ve thrown them away.  Hard to use.  Seldom worked.  My son lost interest each time they\\'d break down.\\nTerrible. Broke the first day.\\nVery stiff doll that is posed in a weird position.  I returned it. Not good at all for young kids.\\nWe\\'ve had 2 of these come now and have died. We\\'ve followed the directions exactly. We\\'ve purchased these directly from Insect Lore before and they survived and worked. Pretty disappointed twice now!\\nDang nab it you ruined it just like anklea zord o wait it don\\'t exist\\nnot very interesting kind of boring\\n\"Sad, I love the style but it also ripped at the toes and I don\\'\\'t have nails to rp through them. Odd too since the socks feels like normal thickness and not a thin one. Maybe the Ouija is telling me somethiing lol. Fast shipping though\"\\n\"Um, there\\'s something the makers of these toys are NOT getting! This, is the Samurai LIGHTZORD! NOT DaiGoyo! Come ON! If the Samurai Gold Ranger were real, he\\'d agree with me! Get the facts straight, Bandai! JEEZ!\"\\nThis item was simply awful.  Our 3 year old wanted to know &#34;why is Donnie\\'s face broken?&#34;.  The piece had been obviously broken before--if not numerous times--and poorly repaired with fragments missing.\\n\"Was badly out of tune. Of course, it is a toy, but it was very badly out of tune. Returned it as defective for exchange and was sent the newer version of this product, not the &#34;Classic Toys&#34; version. I got tired of messing around with Amazon and just kept it. It\\'s been fine.\"\\nThe picture was misleading and could not use.wasn\\'t worth sending back for the price I paid for it.\\n\"Delivery was amazingly quick. Amazon had a later delivery date, but giftologist delivered way quicker for some reason.<br /><br />However, the magnets suck. my 3 year old gets so frustrated with these munipals trains! i\\'ve bought so many thinking that it\\'s just a minor problem but boy was I wrong.<br />the magnets pull apart with just a slight pull with other trains connected. they\\'re great as far as appearance, but for playing with more than one car, they are a total waste. it\\'s incredible that they are not paying attention to reviews!<br />MUNIPALS NEED TO USE STRONGER MAGNETS!!!!\"\\n\"I ordered these for a company event hosting over 100 children. Half of these did not light and many broke. A child got the product in their eyes. It was burning even though it is non-toxic. She was crying. I emailed the company and never received a call to see how the child was doing, or an offer for a refund. We had to pull all of them because we didn\\'t want any other children hurt. It ruined my Kryptonite hunt activity and upset the childs parent. DO NOT BUY!!! I\\'ve purchased better ones elsewhere.\"\\nOver priced! Go to Home Depot. Get an 8\\' x 4\\' melamine sheet (usually labeled as Thrifty White). Ask them to cut it up into squares/rectangles for you. I now have 32 (almost three times the amount they offer here) 1\\' x 1\\' dry erase boards and it cost less than $15!\\nThis is a metallic sticker project.  It is just a flat sheet of paper thin sticker than you fold.\\nHumanities new low.\\nIt\\'s ok but it brakes so easy\\nDisappointing. Really cheap plastic. Maybe my memory is off but I remember the ones from my youth being much more heavy duty plastic. Just seems overall cheap and crappy. Even my 3 yr old could tell it was kinda shoddy. I wouldn\\'t recommend. At $20 feels kinda like a rip off.\\n\"Cheap knock offs. My kids wanted the launchers, but they can rip beys better without them. The beys themselves are also not the quality of the real thing. Really disappointing for the kids.\"\\n\"Me and my Family bought slushy magic about a week ago. At the time, it seemed like a good idea, my sister and I liked the idea and my dad even thought of it as a good idea. So we took the product home with us and read the directions for it. We had to wait the next day till it was good to drink and when I went to bed, I couldn\\'t wait to taste what slushy magic had done. By the time we all woke up and checked it out, it didn\\'t look like a slushy at all. It was almost like it didn\\'t even change since we had put it in there. Basically, it was a piece of junk. We couldn\\'t believe we spent 15.00 on in. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. Very disappointing.\"\\nWould not work right out of the box.\\nNever buy this! It destroyed my puzzle! I did everything it said and it fell apart! It was the worst puzzle saver I have ever bought. Do not buy it!\\n\"Received styrofoam, not plastic or in the wooden crates as described. Scam!\"\\nBought it to work with one of my students and it was broken before I even used it.\\nThis product was labeled as new but was not in it\\'s original packaging.  Not happy!\\nThese stickers are made of a Mylar like material and really don\\'t stick well.\\nBought these for classroom rewards. They broke so easy. Most kids didn\\'t get more then 20 mins of fun out of them.\\n\"I agree. The cube immediatly out of the Amazon box looked dusty and old. The minute I took it out, I could see the stickers being the worst quality ever. And after that, I find a piece snap immediatly after I turned it. Go buy from a different seller, total waste of 30 bucks. (Amazon prime baby!)\"\\n\"I have had to sew the seams on this 3 times. It is not played with, it is a sensory comfort item. Disappointed in this.\"\\nWaaay smaller than I expected\\nThe pack somehow got torn and one of the cards was scratched.\\nDisappointed the cars do not change colors. Since if was labeled as the science lab I assumed the cars were made to change colors. I wouldn\\'t give it a star.\\nLooked great once inflated and my daughter loved it- but it went flat the same day. Must have had a hole coming out of the box because it was not treated roughly. Save your money and buy &#34;disposable&#34; rafts.\\n\"I bought this boat for my daughter and when we got we tried into the pond and it worked for like 1 min and then cut off and it have not worked since.  This is a pile of JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. what a waste of money and also we paid extra for express shipping and we got it 7 days later then it said we was expecting it.\"\\n\"I was very disappointed with this item, probably my fault, but its about 3 inches high and doesn\\'t do anything!!! Wow, for the price, I was not happy.....and would have returned, but it was a gift from Santa.....\"\\n\"This product was delivered to me without any of the connections, leads, or discharging device. In online vieos, I saw others who had a whole kit of things that came with it. The discharging device seems to be a string of three light bulbs and a wire harness to discharge the battery. None of that came with my unit.\"\\ntoo expensive $$$$$$  and the game isn\\'t working anymore\\nI\\'d give it zero if I had to... There wasn\\'t anything to attach the battery to.\\n\"Same with other reviews, I was mislead by the picture and expecting 4.  After I received only one brush then I had a closer look.  It still wasn\\'t crystal clear to me what I should be getting.  But that\\'s the way the business is done and the reason they get only one star.\"\\n\"Ours appeared to have been a returned egg that wS shipped to us the egg did not hVe its outer wrapper, and the alien had a hole in it. I bought this for my neighbor who helps me out. Not. Nice thing to do send out. Returned product. i pId s higher price to get Prime.\"\\n\"This is a HORRIBLE product. First, it didn\\'t even come with the inflating needle mentioned. Second, the net is to even large enough to fit around the top &#34;ring&#34;. Finally, I say &#34;ring&#34; because the PVC pipes don\\'t make a circle, more like a lumpy square-type shape. It cannot even be assembled.\"\\nPoor boxing of product...came severyl dented and unusable.\\nNot Lego brand. plastics feel fragile and the paints are slightly off. pieces fit loosly but not bad for the price my aquaman hands are different in color. my flash has only 1 hand. cyclops face paint is so blotchy. deadpool has a transparent sword holder for some reason and has 1 leg slightly longer than the other. catwoman\\'s face paint is oll. looks like joker got to her.\\nsooo small!!! misleading photo\\n\"This item stopped working properly 1 day after we opened the box.  The unit flew properly 3 times and after that, one side of the units motors were no longer putting out enough momentum to lift that side of the copter.\"\\nReally cheap.\\nIt\\'s great my kids made a noose and hung his terrorist arse\\nThis was not sturdy at all.  Felt like a knock off.  Was missing the blue side and had 2 yellow sides.  Very poor quality.\\n\"Car is not real HOBBY grade as stated, the controller has no trim or adjustments. This HOSIM is the same at :<br />http://www.amazon.com/ToyJoy-Proportional-Included-Waterproof-Electronics/dp/B00VHG5RFY\"\\nit is junk. I returned it\\nHuge Disappointment! The table arrived with 3 legs. It\\'s going back!\\n\"My 3 year old daughter chose these to give to her friends at her birthday party.  We were all disappointed when they arrived.  We received 16, not 24, and of the 16, at least 5 did not work.  I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews before ordering.\"\\nWas not happy.  It\\'s cute and small but the 2 I received has its hair coming off so it was disappointing.\\n\\nThis thing broke shortly after we got it. The balls stop bouncing and we could not figured out why. The kid loved it while it worked\\n\"Was extremely narrow. My 3 year old granddaughter wasn\\'t able to squeeze in to it, but it fit her newborn sister.\"\\n\"The cutting on these stickers was horrible!  I ordered these to use as seals for invitation envelopes.  I could not use over half of them because the cutting around each sticker did not go all the way through, so the sticker tore when you tried to remove them from the paper backing.  So disappointed with these.  I now have to find other stickers.\"\\nDon\\'t buy connections almost never work.\\nVery pricey and very small..expected a bigger and better looking product due to the cost\\n\"Cheaply made- I\\'ve won better toys at the carnival!  The company was accommodating with the return, just difficult to initially get in touch with.\"\\nCame in horrible condition. It was melted and sticky and not at all what I hoped for. The shape of the egg was more of a square because of it melting. Chocolate was not smoothly coated rather just looked old and melted in.\\nIt is fun to fly but the one I received the throttle keeps going even when you shut her down BRUTAL so needless to say it has a mind of its own\\n\"The tablets are extra small in comparison to the Crayola tablets. It takes about ten to give the bath water a strong color. The yellow ones are very weak. They helped give the blue an aquamarine color but over all they are useless. I don\\'t know if all of the crayola tablets will be good, I bought a small box from Target\\'s dollar section. But I will be giving those a shot rather than buy these again.\"\\n\"As opposed to the white pirate alpaca that the picture advertised it as, I received a pink one with an orange scarf. False advertising.\"\\n\"The picture and the presentation of the item caused a misunderstanding in me, thinking it was a doll of 18&#34; tall and a pajama. When I received the item I was pretty mad and disappointed that it\\'s only a pajama and priced so much ! I feel it is scamming customers.<br />Definitely I won\\'t go online buying toys of this brand anymore.\"\\n\"We have many M&D products, including the Pets cube puzzle, which my 2-year old LOVES!  Given his affection for vehicles, I knew he would love this one too.<br /><br />However, the quality is just not the same. The pictures are glued on loosely, with air bubbles and edges over-hanging the block corners. I donut it would last a few days in my household.<br /><br />Oh - and the corners are much sharper than our other one. Not at all what we\\'ve come up expect from this brand.\"\\n\"This battery seemed great, but after about 10 runs it swole up.\"\\n\"VERY cheaply made! Bubble puppy is paper, hat is thin plastic. Hat tore within 30 min of giving it to my son :(\"\\n\"I figured I would buy this as the cost of the other 2 versions (red & purple) are nearly the same price if you purchase both, but this is also the &#34;deluxe&#34; version! I was beyond disappointed when it came.. The metal tin was dented (thanks Amazon/UPS), so it would no longer close. The tin is rather thin and cheap feeling, if it doesn\\'t get dented in shipping it likely will at some point. The &#34;nice&#34; felt inside is just a super cheap plastic insert with a felt-ish feeling on one side, it loosely fits in the tin and feels like it would break with a little use. The dice were rather poor quality with many not having fully filled in pips,etc. The cards are cheap feeling, not perfect printing. The cards also need to be forced into the insert to fit in the tin. Overall all the components fit rather terribly and not well. Again, nothing about this &#34;deluxe&#34; version is deluxe except the level of my disappointment..<br /><br />Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a fun game! but buy the standard versions instead.\"\\nDid not squirt at all.  Very disappointed.  Not worth what I paid for it.\\n\"Terrible experience.  There isn\\'t any reverse.  It only goes forward, and therefore is impossible to get unstuck when it is out of reach.\"\\n\"We bought this for my daughter so that we can be there with her in spirit when she spends the night at her grandparents house.  Although my daughter loved the idea, the execution sucks.  The blue tooth connection takes several tries, it doesn\\'t sync easily.  Unless her toy is on, I can\\'t send her a message, and despite our best efforts, we have not determined how to send her messages through multiple cell phones. She has also been unsuccessful in sending a message to me. Very disappointed.\"\\n\"My son loved it but I guess after 5 months it breaks. Amazon did an amazing job replacing it. Now the new one is broken as well, after 6 months. It\\'s made of plastic so it breaks easily I guess. If we can\\'t return we\\'ll buy a different kind.\"\\ntoo expensive $$$$$$  and the game isn\\'t working anymore\\n\"As others noted, there are no English instructions. Useless.\"\\n\"Small, slow, even my 3 yr old got bored after 10 minutes.  Spend a little extra and get a big boy boat.\"\\n\"it came and the eyes were sewn on much below the red line they\\'re supposed to be on. this is a bootleg, and a horrible waste of money, mine was missing a hand (fin?? thing)\"\\nIt says 4 door but it shows 2 door edition.\\nway too small for any of my granddaughters babies\\n\"Unfortunately when the package arrived and I opened the box, the pink flower was DOA. So no amount of sunshine could make it dance. The trip was too much...I could hear the internal organs of little pink flower rattling around inside of her pretty little pot, but alas my dream of watching little solar powered pink flower dance was crushed too. It was packaged pretty well, so not sure what hostility she met along the way. Returned her and received little green papers back.\"\\n\"The add stated that randomized characters would be shipped. Rather, we received 6 of the exact same character. Further, one of the figures didn\\'t work. Needless to say, our child was very disappointed.\"\\nI was excited to try this drone. After the initial 4 min run time I attempted to charge the battery. I tried to operate the drone and it would not function. Extreamly disappointed. After getting the return authorization I had to pay $16.00 dollars to send this defected product back. Why should I have to pay out of pocket to return a defected product. I could see having to pay just to return it because I didn\\'t like it. But not a defected product. I will never purchase from this company again. Real bitter taste.<br /><br />William in Virginia\\n\"Good price considering the price one would pay elsewhere. BUT, it came broken. The bubble mechanism works but the music does not play. A neighbor friend bought it for their son, and they said theirs came broken as well. We kept ours because our kids are just happy about the bubbles even though they do complain about it not playing music.\"\\n\"I ended up with an item that was previously returned. i could tell because it was 1/2 way put together. the rotating musical portion wouldnt rotate..it was stuck and making clicking noises.<br /><br />If it did work...I still would not have liked it...it was very soft with no substance to it. toys very plush and canopy very plush...so plush it didnt hold its shape very well. BUT, if it ever fell...I would not worry about it hurting a baby...I would worry more about it suffocating a baby. However, that would be with any product like this. The mechanism for attaching to the crib seemed sturdy...I wasn\\'t worried about it becoming unattached.\"\\nBox was crushed on top.\\nI\\'m VERY disappointed in this backpack/lunch box combo! My son used this less than an hour to carry his school supplies to meet his teacher and the lunch box zipper broke and the strap connecting the lunchbox to the backpack came apart! We left the lunch box attached because he was so excited about it he wanted so show all his friends. The only thing in his lunch box was his EMPTY matching thermos. He isn\\'t even going to get to taking it to the first day of school! Please don\\'t waste your money!!\\n\"This does not even deserve a review as the model came 90% done by someone, we got scammed. Returning immediately.\"\\nComplete game of chance. The only strategy involved can be picked up by a five year old after two rounds. This may be a good fame for smaller kids.\\n\"Really disappointed in all Aquabot products.  My son loved them, it worked initially but it stopped working within a week of purchasing.\"\\nLasted for a whole 3 days. Inflated about 10 balloons.\\nBroke after 1 day\\n\"These are awful. The gold is NOT gold glitter, it is a picture of gold glitter. Looks cheap and tacky. Don\\'t waste your money!\"\\nBreaks after a few use. Bought twice thinking I had a lemon but it is just not a durable item.\\n\"don\\'t expect a book, this is so tiny it is not suitable for children....very disappointing\"\\n\"We have four of these pool toys. They were great at first but within a month stopped working. I kept buying different animals hoping for longevity, but it wasn\\'t to be.\"\\n\"This arrived on time for my son\\'s 5th birthday. I expected it to be better quality plastic toy. Also, the screw that holds the battery cover on was stripped so much that I almost had to break it open to put the batteries in. I\\'m pretty sure that after my rough and tumble 5 yr old plays with it a while it won\\'t stay closed on its own and I\\'ll have to tape it shut. The batteries quit working all together last night after my sonplayed with it a few minutes after school. I will be returning this and ordering him a different toy for his birthday.\"\\nDo not buy this! It\\'s a bootleg of the official version. Do not support bad quality bootlegs. The colors are off and just doesn\\'t look nice compared to the authentic ones.<br /><br />The official angry open mouth Pikazard and are stictched towards it\\'s cheeks not to it\\'s tummy.\\nI was expecting a REAL PIÑATA not just a white bag with the some strings on it . Can\\'t believe I just  spent 44 bucks on this . Should have gone to a party place store instead . The only thing was good out of this kit was the candy . My kid was not even excited about this piñata when she saw it  . The picture seem good but when I saw it I got mad . The price of this should at lease 15 bucks . 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡\\n\"The plastic lenses distorted my vision too much to wear these for any length of time. Distracting, instant headache.\"\\nI purchased 2 of these because the first one was not as described and now they are both the same. The description states if you press on Mickey\\'s shoe you\\'ll here the song &#34;Here Comes the Bride&#34; These do not have any music boxes in them they are simply over priced stuffed animals.\\nBroke right away.\\n\"To put is simply and accurately, it\\'s junk. I had one when I was a kid and the rocket would go 25 - 30 feet. The best I could get with this set was 5 feet. It is poorly constructed of flimsy plastic and seems very prone to breakage in the hands of my grandson.\"\\n\"A HUGE disappointment! Large describes the no. of pieces in the box, NOT the size of the pieces. This was bought for our 3 yr old grandson, for his birthday, and the box did not contain the large sized pieces we were expecting. This is not designed for a 3 year old & is potentially dangerous for a child who might put the small pieces in his/her mouth.\"\\n\"Looked good at first but then I saw that it was a clear sticker and it went down from there. When I placed on my car window you could not see it at all! I then tried to remove it to place it in another location, but all the glue came off!\"\\nThe fish kept filling with water and sinking so it was too heavy for the magnet. I have bought one before and there were no issues...\\n\"I sent two of these packs to boys ages 11 and 13 and they both said it was pretty bad.<br /> Also, I was unable to see what was included on the site.\"\\n\"It\\'sy Baby was NOT what we ordered for a baby shower.... What my creative brother in law did was cut the Y out, drew a line to make it look like an A, and hung it in the middle upside down. Once that was completed it looked like a 5 star banner. But I\\'d like people to know what they\\'re paying for....\"\\nMore like 30 small random pieces.\\nI love law but this hat is terrible\\n\"I can\\'t stress how disappointing and terribly designed this set is. The pieces only connect together at right angles--extremely limiting-- and even then they in no way lock or hold together well. Anything you build is bound to fall apart super easily. Moreover, the set comes with barely enough pieces to make anything. The box and instructions are full of pictures of things that (read the fine print) you need to buy other Roominate kits to actually build. Nearly any other building set will be a better option.\"\\nThey wormy what I thought. The putty will get hard and unable to squeeze the more you play with it\\nTwice in a pool and paint off\\nNo English instructions.\\n\"Stay away from this product!!! My daughter received this as a gift. I let her play with it once since I trusted the box saying &#34;non-toxic&#34;, but there is something wrong here. Nothing that has this strong of a chemical smell can be non-toxic.  The fumes gave me a headache and I felt lightheaded.\"\\nJUNK! No belt clip. 6 pieces in less than 5 minutes.\\nThese are too small to travel very far.\\n\"The stickers are cool, but at 4.25 for one pack of 4 sheets of stickers, this is a ripoff!! I thought that I would get 4 sets of stickers when I bought it.\"\\n\"How it should work: Child sends a message from pet and it comes in to my phone.  I reply to message and it goes to directly to the cloud pet. How it does work: Child sends a message to their own profile,  you switch from your profile to theirs to receive it then forward it to your own inbox. To reply, record and send a message from the adult profile, send it to the child profile. Then log into the child profile and forward it from their inbox to the pet.\"\\nThis is a piece of material (the front of the dress) glued to a piece of cardboard (the back of the dress).  This is not a complete piece of clothing for a 1:12 scale doll to wear.  This item was a complete disappointment and not worth the cost.  Enclosed is a picture of the back of :the dress&#34;\\n\"Absolute dookie. I purchased this because of the fact it said &#34;waterproof&#34; it should say &#34;sponge&#34;<br />I bought it specifically for a river tubing trip/bachelor party and after 10 min.

I was very disappointed with this product.\"\\n\"(Updated see below) The pack has not yet been put to use, but upon arrival appears just as the picture shows.  The back pack is roomy.  I love the front pouch which includes the fabric folder (with pockets).  The lunch box is attached on both sides by velcro straps that weave through buckle on the lunch bag.  I\\'m not sure how strong these straps will be once the lunch bag is filled...but there is an extra velcro strap that holds in the folder, that can be used as extra hold just by weaving it through the handle.  Overall, my daughter loves the pack, and I\\'m happy with the purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: The lunch bag zipper broke the first week of school.  The back pack zipper broke 3rd week of school.  Maybe I got a reject?  But when the zipper breaks, the bag is useless as the bag cannot be zipped or closed.  It\\'s unfortunate, I liked the design of the bag.  But total waste of money.\"\\nbasically no sound\\nDoes not fit the proto x slt (same as proto x blades). Why would you claim this?

It was brand new and already broken.\\n\"What is pictured and what I received are two very different things. Beware  if you are expecting them to look like the picture, they do not.\"\\n\"I plan to write to the company about the poor quality of this product.  What a disappointment!  I will brave the heat, spiders, and rodents to search my mom\\'s attic for my original.  I purchased this for my advanced 3 year-old to make learning her letters and words fun and hands-on.  There are careless errors in this redesign, but first let me discuss the egregious error in manufacturing/quality control: Several of our letters are backwards!  Yes, for a toy that is intended to help teach children their letters, this is absolutely ridiculous.  The front side of the letters has an indented pattern and the back is supposed to be hollow, which is fine -- good, actually, so kids can dump them out and then figure out how to place them face-up without adult assistance, BUT several of our letters must be face-down to be correct!  Talk about confusing!  I expected much better from this big toy tycoon!<br /><br />Rather than take the opportunity to capitalize on producing an improved version of a toy that is well-loved by the current child-bearing generation, Fisher Price totally botched this classic toy re-release with a barrage of poor design choices:<br /><br />1) The board is not magnetic (nor are the letters or the cards).  What I thought would be a good, all-inclusive, self-contained lap toy for the car, I now realize will be a disaster, as the letters will be dropped, cards will be dropped, etc.<br /><br />2) There\\'s nothing to truly keep the cards in place, and since the board and cards are not magnetic, when you lift up the storage area beneath the card &#34;stand&#34; to get a letter, the card slides all around, potentially messing up the letters the child has already placed correctly.<br /><br />3) The cards are not true stencils as I remember.  Maybe I am not remembering correctly, but I thought you could just draw w/chalk in the card and that would form a perfect, guided version of the letters in the word.  Not so with these cards, as they are not true stencils.There\\'s extra &#34;room&#34; so that a child who does not already know how to form the letter cannot use tracing the card as a learning tool.  This poor design of the cards also makes it difficult for letter-learners to identify which letter is supposed to be in the space, since the outline does not necessarily look like the letter shape that matches/fills the space.<br /><br /> If I were you, I\\'d skip this entirely and scour local yard sales, thrift stores, or ebay for the original version.\"\\nPoor quality and a huge mess. Not impressed with the eruption.  😕\\nTent sets up easily but balls deflate too quick for a 6 month old being the only one playing with them.\\nI\\'m so disappointed just received this package for my daughter and it was completely broken.

Pushing it you obtain a back ache.  I gave it to our grand-daughter\\'s parents to try, they experienced the same.<br />The handle is the problem, it is great for loading in the vehicle, just not a good design for pushing the car, would not recommend it.\"\\nIt is missing so many pieces it isn\\'t even funny!

Bought for my daughter and based on the sizing guide it should have fit her but it didnt. I tried it on (34 yrs old 125 lbs) and this was huge on me it\\'s not even funny. They need to work on their sizing. Luckily AMAZON is amazing when it comes to returns so I had no problen returning it. Just a hassle especially when it\\'s meant to be worn on a specific date.\\nThe LED light was so small that you couldn\\'t even tell it was illuminated. While blowing up the balloons we had about 15 that burst or had small pin holes in them and after spending 2 hours inflating with helium the balloons were deflated 8 hours later. Terrible.<br />Stephanie\\nVery cheap. As I opened the package feathers fell to the floor. The Boa was stiff and itchy. I would not buy again nor recommend that anyone buy this item. You would be better off purchasing one from a party supply store\\n\"I am extremely disappointed with this toy. It broke after my nephew played with it once. The string device to attach the race car and tow truck does not work after a two year old only played with it a few hours.

It came crooked with several of the chains broken. Wishing I could give zero stars.... DO NOT BUY!\\n\"The first helicopter that arrived obviously had a broken gear and was returned. The replacement didn\\'t fly either. The rotors spun and the controls worked but not enough power to lift off. Being a curious fellow, I dismantled it and found serious build problems. Cold soldering, wires pinched in the assembly, frayed wire with damaged insulation, bent frame parts, gears loose on the motor shafts. It is no wonder it didn\\'t fly, but I\\'m really surprised it turned on at all.\"\\nnot enough boom.\\n\"I wasn\\'t impressed by this. The picture doesn\\'t show the &#34;drainage holes&#34; that are in the cover. All the holes seem to do is allow the cover to sink into the pool allowing dirt, bugs, and debris into the water.  We have to leave our pool rafts in there to prevent the cover from sinking.\"\\n\"Cheap material, the case broke so fast. The plastic is super thin. Only lasted about a week\"\\n\"Don\\'t waste your time with this junker.  This is our third attempt to use this tank. The first one had its cheap plastic antenna snap off. The replacement only have one tread that worked. And the replacement for that, exactly the same, had one only one tread that works. The entire thing seems cheaply put together and not worth the money. Avoid this one at all costs and look for a better option.\"\\n\"Do not buy, this kit will literally NEVER be worth almost 100$ for 10$ worth of plastic\"\\nEven the circle clear stickers meant for picking up the graphite powder did not peel off the backing paper cleanly.\\nThe packaging was damaged.

DO NOT BUY!\"\\nThis is now the second time this pool has had a hole in it. I was going to try to exchange it again but my return window is closed. I\\'m not happy about this at all.\\nIt did not last more than a month.  Easy to set up. We put on the cement driveway with an under barrier to protect the liner.  By the end of the month the side walls were curling inward on 1/3 to 1/2 of the pool.  We tried more water but they still curled in sent water out.  The bottom liner seemed to shift.  It was only used for my new grandchild and her mother to cool off and teach her to be calm in water in the floater seat.  We covered it with light weight clear plastic sheeting.  Twice put a little bleach in to keep slime out.  1 1/2 months later terrible looking and almost unusable already.  I had one many years ago for my son in 1983 and we did not have this problem at all.\\nOther reviews said these would go down the stairs.\\nvery slow and poor quality\\nDon\\'t waste your money on this product. First of all it took too long to get delivered second the shirt looks and feel like something u could buy some dollar store. Real cheap material. And to top it off it doesn\\'t even say &#34;ADIDAS&#34; on the front of the shirt. Please don\\'t waste $30 on this lame product.\\nPOS.  I live in the city and I believe I have great water pressure.  My sprinkler shoots across my whole yard.  With that being said I still don\\'t have enough water pressure to fill the slip n slide. I don\\'t recommend this product to anyone unless you want disappointed children or you live near a body of water and have a powerful pump.\\n\"Great, the title says colors may vary, but when you order it, the price and shipping is based on the color you choose, Green $15.36, Pink $26.14, or Blue $17.92. I ordered the blue, cuz Green (gender neutral) wasnt prime eligible and I need it for this weekend in Vegas (the lazy river charges $30). I received my shipment today, and its freaking pink! What the heck, I am married and comfortable with my sexuality so will use it but the fact that I ordered a specific color only to receive a color that I didn\\'t want. I had a 33% chance to get Pink and somehow I got it even though its the most expensive. I guess I should be thrilled, but I am only going to use it once. Hopefully it works well, but as of now I am very disappointed with this seller as my friends (who are mostly blue collar: Cop, plumbers, an aerospace mechanic, fireman, and a PR manager) will probably give me s*** but I can deal with that and have the PR manager release a statement to them about the color.\"\\n\"Very &#34;soft&#34; plastic/rubber used for this piece, so much so that it is too flimsy to even stand.  In fact, I believe that the left leg is actually a bit longer then the right leg...also contributing to the standing problems.  Another aspect to this piece that I don\\'t like is that the figure is not made to properly (or easily) hold the weapons.  Aside from all this, the figure IS very detailed and looks amazing.  Unfortunately, since the thing can\\'t even stand, it can\\'t be displayed.  NOT GOOD.  BUYER BEWARE.\"\\nVery thin cheap plastic. It doesn\\'t go as fast as the description says and when it came it had a crack on one side. I would not recommend this to anyone.\\nSave your money!! $30 is way more than this product is worth. Looks like everything was bought at the $1 store. No name brand stuff at all and I\\'m super disappointed :(\\nGave just one shock so weak I could just barely detect.<br /><br />Seems the prank was on me for buying this.\\n\"This was purchased as a gift for my six month old son. It worked perfectly for a couple of months before it developed what I can only liken to a severe case of Tourette\\'s. Completely unprovoked, it has begun exclaiming &#34;BROWN!&#34; intermittently. To make matters worse, when my son is playing with it, it constantly interrupts itself, such that it sounds something like, &#34;purpl -- BROWN! Oran -- BROWN! BROWN!&#34; When you compress the body of the octoplush, it begins to play one of several musical numbers that Baby Einstein is renowned for. Not so for this dysfunctional cephalopod, because as soon as the music-box style tune begins, it is cut short by ecstatic proclamations of &#34;BROWN! BROWN!&#34;<br />To be fair, my son doesn\\'t seem to mind, but I\\'ll confess that it\\'s driving me nuts. &#34;BROWN! BROWN!&#34; And if he were to attempt to learn anything from this toy, it would be that, ultimately, everything is brown.\"\\ncan\\'t see the dominos and it falls over.  Bought it for playing on the picnic table; but doesn\\'t work.\\n\"The item illustration clearly show a visible date, the coin received has no trace of a visible date, buyer beware.\"\\n\"Awful product, I got it as a gift to a friend\\'s kid birthday , I could not attend the birthday, and I kept it to use if for a different occasion, as no party came up, I opened the package to play with it few days ago, and it never even got turned on, waste of money :(\"\\ntoo expensive $$$$$$  and the game isn\\'t working anymore\\nPaint is gloopy and doesn\\'t stand out on our sidewalk at all.

Even when I used scissors to creatively separate a couple of images, I was only up to 12 tattoos with pups. Very disappointed - was going to use these as party favors.\"\\nMy 2 year old easily broke off pieces of this truck 😐. So disappointed considering price\\nShabby construction\\nThe silicone didn\\'t set even after leaving it over night.<br />Very disappointng for my daughter :(\\nUnable to open crayon drawer as crayons became unsettled during shipment and are in disarray and broken.\\nkind of sucks...\\n\"I received the 2015 model of the car, instead of the 2014 model pictured on the description.\"\\n\"Very disappointed! Its a piece of junk, Dont waste your money on this.\"\\nI purchased this LeapBand in June for my daughter\\'s birthday in August. Apparently I didn\\'t pay any attention when it was delivered because when we were getting it set up for her we noticed 2 very deep gouges in the screen. It will still work but I am disappointed in the poor quality of what was delivered to me. I expect more from Amazon.\\nOurs was missing two pieces...\\n\"I never write reviews, but this is a terrible toy. The flavor packets taste disgusting.  The handle constantly breaks off even if you crush the ice in blender.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy this toy.  Your kids will just end up disappointed and you will be frustrated.\"\\nIt is NO good<br />Could not even put it together. The pieces wouldn\\'t connect much less extend into a toy weapon. Should have listened to previous reviews.\\n\"Got 2 of the same characters. My cousin was very disappointed, especially since they weren\\'t good characters\"\\nVery very tiny!\\nIntended to use these as Wedding favors but the ear pieces are way too small/ short.\\nCompletely awful!!! Such a waste a money. I should of bought them way before my sons birthday bash and tried them....very disappointed with this product....\\n\"Bought this as a collector, and was really disappointed by the produce.  The item was chipped and the paint rubbed off.  Package was bad too.\"\\nThis is not a true 3D Crystal Puzzle but a cheap imitation. It\\'s not the same number of pieces and bottom line do not buy this puzzle!\\nMakes a TERRIBLE LOUD SOUND!!\\nThis popped after our 2nd use.  I don\\'t recommend it.\\nThe assembly instructions for this item were pictures not words and we found them very confusing.  Advertising this item for 8 years or older was misleading.  Our 11 year old got very frustrated and needed a lot of help with the assembly.  We waited for the penguin to charge and lo and behold NOTHING happened.  The penguin doesn\\'t move at all - my husband who is a design engineer took the thing apart and re-assembled it with the same results!\\n\"Not happy with this product.. It folds and bends in severely. I do like the size.. It is very big. But not very durable.. I bought this product to put my kids stuffed animals in. The top does not close, due to the front bending in..\"\\nThe neck is huge and awkward\\nLooks really cute...but it must not be meant to be held because the first time my kid strummed the strings they broke. And no they were not wound too tight. Cheap quality. Very unhappy about that.\\nNot as advertised\\nI was excited to receive this for my 9 month old daughter; when it arrived it was filthy. I tried cleaning and just could not get it looking new. Sadly I will be returning it tomorrow.\\n\"First of all, it did not come with the peak charger described but with a common wall charger.  After a couple of mails, the peak charger was sent to the carrier in Miami (I live in Colombia), so it will be some time before I get it and use it.<br />The first time I charged the battery with the wall charger, the boat performed perfectly.  The second and third time I charged it, the battery lasted a minute or so. I have not used it since.\"\\nThis product was returned the minute I opened the package. This is something that I could make at home using construction paper and crayons. Nothing special here. This is the first time I ever returned a package to Amazon. What a waste of time.\\n\"Bought these for a friend, who reported that the balloon sticks was severely short of the 144 count that is advertised. At least there were enough to serve our intended purpose. We were slightly disappointed at their quality (cheaper than other balloon sticks that we first purchased) and, obviously, the missing parts.\"\\nHorrible product!! Very cheaply made.

So mad!\\nTwo piece of the puzzle broke off the day it was used as a mind teaser for 5th graders.\\n\"Worst quality I\\'ve ever seen, eyes are stickers and they left an air bubble on one and the plastic seemed as it had been in a fire then sent out to me\"\\n\"it worked great for drilling small sea glass pieces for the first 20min, and then it wouldn\\'t turn back on.

I just bought another set of these after buying another set less than a year ago (so I would have enough for my kids), and they aren\\'t the same color and they don\\'t stack to the other set either.  I am very disappointed, and cannot afford $30.00+ to buy the 300 piece set.\"\\n\"10$ retail value in Japan...10$ more for shipping to US. This kit is literally 10$ worth of plastic it will NEVER be worth more than 25$ max...how a high grade kit that isn\\'t premium bandai got to be almost 4 times its official set price I will never know...DO NOT BUY THIS KIT NOW, wait until bandai restocks and price drops.\"\\n\"Regarding other reviews for this item, I find it very suspicious that most of the people who got it for free liked it, but most of the people who paid their own money think it\\'s junk. Draw your own conclusions about what that really means. ;-)<br /><br />Anyway... I bought this (despite the sketchy reviews) because I needed a big, realistic looking model of a plane for a stage production, and I didn\\'t want to pay an outrageous amount of money (seriously, a good quality real model this size will cost something like $200 if you can even find it).<br /><br />Pros: it\\'s big and it looks realistic (except for the lump under the wings with the motor and wheels).<br /><br />Cons are pretty much everything else:<br />- The electronics were dead. I tried two different sets of batteries but couldn\\'t get any lights, sounds, or motor operation.<br />- Fit and finish is poor. Parts don\\'t line up perfectly, some surfaces look grungy or scuffed.<br />- One wing is more curved/bent than the other.<br />- The motor under the wings is mounted slightly off center so the whole thing sits slightly tilted to one side (and the bent wing doesn\\'t help).<br />- Each wing has a big sticker on it that says &#34;AIRPLANE&#34;, which looks very dumb (the other stickers look OK).<br />- The stand is thin plastic (not metal as some other reviewers have stated), and it\\'s kind of teetery.\"\\nThis has been nothing but disappointing since my daughter opened it 1 hour ago.  Most frustrating is that the 2 glitter glues were essentially empty and the craft glue was completely dried out.  My 9 year old also commented repeatedly how misleading the packaging is...\\nI bought this item only because of the ceramic rod in the middle. The one that I had on my pools pump broke into pieces. I was using a substitute item that was only last for a few days so I broke down and bougt the actual part. It broke in a week so now i am back to basically rigging this pump because the part broke again. This part needs to be made of stainless steel. Something none corrosive but strong. I dont think anybody that can make a decision on this product is reading this but if you are and you want to fix the problem and really want my opinion please send me and email with your questions\\nIt doesn\\'t work.\\nHorrible quality. The material was frayed and looked dirty upon opening. Very disappointed.\\nThe peppa pig I received was NOT a Ty Beanie Baby!!!!!! It is simply a plush toy. No bean bag tush like our other Peppa Pig Ty Beanie Babies. I don\\'t like being tricked! Zero stars was not an option\\n\"Dustless it certainly is not!  The first thing that greeted me on opening this box of chalk was a face full of chalk dust... and that was only after removing the shrink wrap.  Even more chalk dust waited for me inside the box... along with 11 shattered sticks of chalk. One stick remains unbroken. If the product cannot withstand normal shipping and handling, it cannot receive a high quality rating from me.  So, caviat emptor.  The low cost is the only reason I am giving this a full one-star review.  It is an acceptable alternative (maybe) for children - if you can find it in a store that\\'s local to you, so much the better - maybe.  Would I buy it again? No.  Recommended - no.\"\\n\"First, the description indicates that this magnifier has an LED light. It does NOT! Second, it\\'s cheap and practically worthless. The magnifier assembly has no downward stop, so the lenses drop down to far. The tensioners on the sides fail to prevent it.

It was easy to put together, although the instructions were not much help. Once my husband and I put it together, it looked amazing. It\\'s really big, our dining room table was barely big enough to hold it. The remote controls are connected to the track with a cord, which wasn\\'t really a problem, but you do have to stand in one place so you don\\'t tangle the cords. The mini cooper cars were light, held no batteries (the batteries go in a box on the track), but rather had magnets, which is how they move. The track had a groove in the center and the cars had a tab which went into the track. This is where the engineering was flawed. This did not hold the cars in place AT ALL. Consequently, the cars were so light and the force at which they move was so fast (and sudden), if you push the button on the remote control all the way down, the cars flew off the track constantly. I do mean CONSTANTLY. If the cars were a bit heavier, they might have stayed on the track better. I will say, there was a sweet spot in the remote control: if you hold the trigger down half-way, the cars could make the entire lap around the track. But, for a kid, it\\'s nearly impossible to hold the trigger with such precision. We tried to make this work because it looked really cool and had a kitschy-nostalgic vibe to it, like a toy you\\'d find in the 70\\'s, but it was just cheaply made. Sorry to say, we had to return it.\"\\nok so all the intex tubes 18 i bought last year all have holes in them.  the seams don\\'t hold.  i wouldn\\'t purchase intex again.\\nThis brand and style used to be our &#34;go to&#34; floats but the last two we received must not have been of the same quality. The mesh started ripping within a week. I\\'m staying away from this float. What a waste of money.\\nI couldn\\'t get it to work and never got a response back to my e-mail.\\n\"The package was a resealed box (with sticky tape and weird used wrapping).<br />The product was used or off a display. (see photo as an example).<br />I asked for a refund and got into multiple emails with the seller bargaining me down $3 refund, then $5 instead of a full refund or replacement.<br />When i suggested a replacement he said they were all like this.<br />Don\\'t buy if you want your kids to play with a nice gift, buy if you want some used junk.<br />Waste of time and energy.\"\\nVery cheap. Several broke.\\n\"The 1968 long-box pictured in the sale is not what I recieved (worth 150.00).

Board was approximately 12&#34; and king was approximately 1.5&#34;. Returned item for refund.\\nOrdered two of these Shopkins Season 2 12-packs. What I received was two 12 packs of obvious counterfeit toys taped inside tampered original Shopkins trademarked packaging. The character colors of some pieces do not match the character colors of the trademarked Shopkins line of toys. The paint was smeared and the face paint didn\\'t line up with the imprints on the toys. Both packages were still opened at the bottom and top while the sides were sealed with clear packing tape to hold the packaging together. Each package is supposed to have a special edition &#34;Fluffy Baby&#34; figure as it stated on the packaging. Neither package had any special edition &#34;Fluffy Baby&#34; Shopkin inside (see pics) as they had been removed and replaced with cheap counterfeit toy figures. These were intended to be a gift.  Thanks for nothing but a hassle!\\n\"Gave this as a gift - it didn\\'t work well, got replaced, still not great.

Not even close to a good deal, even with the price.  Don\\'t bother.\"\\nBest great  awesome  best\\n\"Horrible product that broke after 5 minutes!  It totally stopped walking and flipping over.

Although the Minion set is cheap, the quality is bad and I do not believe Universal Studios had ever authorized this seller to build such poor quality product.  I would not recommend this product for kids.\"\\nThis didn\\'t even last past two hours in the water before it stopped working.  Terrible!\\nToy is cheaply made and arrived broken. Side rail was broken and all of the wheels didn\\'t turn - both cheap plastic. Train barely moves when pulled back and made no noise at all.

The drop down switch won\\'t go up on one side. The toy itself is nice, but the switching mechinism is poorly made.\"\\nLacks air flow needs to be bigger\\n\"My son has been waiting to find this toy. He saved up his birthday money to purchase himself. He loves the Imaginext line of superhero toys and has had some for 5 years, without problems. Well, with the Playskool version the main Iron man figure lost it\\'s arm after an hour of play. Poor kid was inconsolable. Playskool replaced the toy within 3 weeks. The second figure broke after only four days.\"\\nThe entire cube fell apart into individual squares in a few days.  Happy I was able to return it for a refund.\\nIt\\'s nice but u have to take  phone out to use it so it leaves phone with no protection or press really hard on the screen.\\n\"Much smaller than anticipated. May be ok for a 2 or 3 year old, but I would not recommend it\"\\nThe product description says they are suitable for children from 3months-1year. These are definitely too small for children less than 2-3 years. They are a choking hazard.\\n\"I bought this as a step stool for the kitchen, to help me and my wife reach things on the upper shelves. It collapses nicely, is easy to pick up and set up, but to lock the side panels in position takes a bit of extra work. If the side panels are not locked in, then it is a bit wobbly. At 185 pounds, it works well for me when locked, but not otherwise. As I am not always wanting to take the extra few steps to lock the panels when I just need to reach that upper shelf to put something up, I am not sure this will be the right tool.  UPDATE 9/18/15 -- Over a few months of use, all of the plastic hinges have bent, come apart, or broken off. This particular unit should not be used by adults, probably should not be on the market at all.\"\\n\"If there was a way to leave 0 stars I would.

No matter how much I form the obvious twists it won\\'t fly straight, so whoever gets the orange one will be at a disadvantage.  I have no idea why they decided that this toy needed a bag; the Firefox and generic ones we got just came in boxes. The blue one came in a larger cellophane bag and flew straight right out of the box. Edit: I left the thing lying in the sun and it didn\\'t help.\"\\nFirst flight - fell only 20 feet and found myself soldering the video component back on.

He saw it cheaper from other sellers but he noticed that the joints and the painting around the eyes was different with the cheaper sellers. He decided to go with the more expensive option as the picture shown matched the joints of his other hedgehog. However, when it arrived, he discovered, after opening the package, that the joints and painting around the eyes were the same as the cheaper sellers and in fact differed from the photo.

However, after attempting to attach to my phantom 2 with the GoPro, I noticed that it will not fit. The rounded corners inside of the bracket do not allow the GoPro to fit all the way into the bracket. I will attempt to use a Dremel tool to remove some excess material from the bracket so that it will work with my GoPro. On another note, the hex screws are not the same size as the screws from the other bracket. I was able to use some extra screws that came with my phantom (M2.5×6.3). Switching to these screws allowed me to use one tool for all of the allen screws on the drone.  Update: I was able to grind out the inside corners using a Dremel tool. It works and is holding my GoPro in securely. I am still giving this product 1 star because it is useless without the modifications that I have made.\"\\nI purchased this for my nephew.

We love games, and when our daughter was &#34;into&#34; Thomas, we thought it would be great to add this to our game closet. That was a few years ago. We\\'ve pulled it out a few times since then, and every time get bored after the first few spins and never finish. The game is terribly designed. The general concept is you play as one of 4 of the classic characters, spinning a wheel to move spaces around the island, stopping at stations to perform an activity until you eventually reach the end. Before you start, you decide which stations you want to land on, then it\\'s the luck of the spin as to whether or not you land on them, and whether or not you have to circle around the island again. The activities at each station are lame. At one, you pretend to eat an ice cream cone, and that earns you the station\\'s star. At another, you sing your favorite song. At another, you choose a card that displays a number of rabbits and ask the other players to guess how many rabbits are on the card. These aren\\'t even interesting to our 4 year old. The worst part is it takes A LONG time to move from station to station, and if you miss, you have to circle around again. The game could potentially go on forever. It\\'s just boring and too long.

Half-way through the flight one of the propellers seized up and stopped working.  The motor started to smell like something burning, but no actual smoke.

While the overall design - aesthetically - is very nice, the actual manufacture of it is not. What\\'s up Funko? C\\'mon! Regretting the money I paid for this one. Clearly someone at Funko has no concept of physics because May\\'s body is so thin and her feet so small that her heavy head (more on the head later) clearly takes command and she falls over every.single.time. She is now leaning against a mirror so that she can stand with the rest of my collection. Shame. Re the head, the last couple of Funkos I\\'ve purchased have come out of the box with the heads tilted slightly to the right and not straight. Again, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Hoping Funko gets their act together before the September 1, 2015 release of the Agent Carter one. \\'Cause nobody messes with Peggy Carter!!!

Company did provide refund.\"\\n\"There is nothing like trying to set up this waterslide while four children already wearing bathing suits watch with baited breath. Obviously whoever wrote the instructions on the sheet and on the box had no idea how this slide should be set up.  First I helped my neighbor set up a single-lane version of this slide, and the instruction sheet was meaningless--it did not even show how to connect the slide to the hose or why two connectors were provided, one fitted inside the other. Nevertheless, I decided to invest in the triple slide because my grandchildren were coming for a visit. The same sheet of vague instructions came with the triple slide, and they were _still_ not applicable!  The outside of the box says to fill the ramp with water, but we found out the hard way that you only fill two small _side pouches_ with water. The middle section is to be filled with air, which we accomplished using the inflator for an air mattress. (Do this first before adding any water, and make sure all the air and water openings are closed tightly.) For a while a water leak from one of the openings prevented our tube from filling all the way, but eventually the slide performed well--water spewed from both sides, and a nice splash pool gathered at the end. After about 15 minutes, the end of the splash pool got a huge hole in it (the 2-inch patch provided in the box is a joke), so we had to close the tube with a clothes pin in order to force the water out of the holes on the left side, which allowed the slide to stay wet. The kids had been jumping over the ramp anyway, so we found that by turning the slide end-for-end down a slight slope, a pool of water gathered against the ramp at the bottom, and the ramp nicely launched our rough-and-ready group into the grass, which they enjoyed. At last check, the ramp had also deflated, but luckily the kids wore out before it did. Six college graduates never did figure out why the second hose connector was included. I suppose Bestway Toys could care less about the quality of their product now that they have my $26, but I would certainly not recommend their brand to anybody else.\"\\nmooooooooooo stupid cow . you suck pokemon kard\\n\"I just gave this as a gift, almost a year after purchase, so now I cannot return it.

This is obviously a cheap knock off. I am adding pictures as a warning to others. Note the differences. The box has no latch. There are only 2 sets of brass stripes and not 3 across the front of the box. The only lining is in the lid of the box. The anchor inlay on the lid is obviously a cheaper rendition. The sextant itself is very different. It is not engraved &#34;Hampton Nautical&#34;, it has no engraving at all. Note the slow motion control; on the one I received it is located underneath and is very loose. The built-in-magnifier is nothing like the one in the picture. There are 4 swing-arm filters and not the 6 depicted and described. This is not what I paid for and I would really like to have the one that is described here, but it would appear that, that is not going to happen. I am extremely DISAPPOINTED Amazon! This is nothing short of irresponsible behavior.\"\\nNot water proof... Don\\'t waste your money\\nI didn\\'t meet me expectations. The photo in your site showed three different posters in this pack.

One of the greatest difficulties is that it must be done with exact attention to the order of the instructions.

Well those reviewers were right - the gun is constantly jammed. The bullet is hollowed out nerf - a pin in the chamber has to slide into the hollow part in order to load each round. If the bullet is even slightly misshapen (which they all pretty much are because they are soft nerf) the pin doesn\\'t line up with the hole, so the bullets just get crushed and jammed in the chamber. The QA tester for Nerf must have been on vacation when this toy came up for review. Would definitely not recommend.\"\\nNot good at all to small for d price.\\nIt shoots about ten feet.

The paint job and general appearance is decent, and he looks just like the character does in the game. However I feel like the flawed and shoddy execution ( for the price it should be much better) is just indicative of Blizzard as a really bad gaming company, they have become greedy, apathetic, incompetant, and really have forgotten what a great and loyal game company they USED to be, they only make games and products to make money not satisfy customers. I bought this but with all the unresolved problems I have had with their games and that incredibly infuriating battlenet and the terrible customer service I will never spend another cent towards their products. Sideshow is also to blame but Blizzard approved the product, or if they didnt then they should of- either way another fail in Blizzards long list of total letdowns and poor service. Box is crap foam and the light up features do not work on mine. Figure could have been half the size and twice the quality and it would have made all the difference in the world. Blizzards new slogan must be &#34;who cares if its crap someone will still buy it, and as long as we have the customers money who cares if it works or pleases the customer&#34;.

They are very difficult to climb aboard and once on the pool lounger, it\\'s necessary to lie very still or you will find yourself falling overboard. Secondly, the &#34;cup holders&#34; are useless because your body will take up the entire lounger so there is no place for your drinks to be placed.\"\\nBroke first time used.

It looked like an previously owned puzzle which was already worked several times\\n\"There were supposed to be 7 beyblades and we only received one. very poor advertising and misleading! My son is very upset about this. Also, it didn\\'t come with a launcher.\"\\nUsed only 2 times. Bad design with seam on bottom of steps where pressure would b. S/h/b placed on top of steps. 1 step\\'s seam  split\\nThey are just regular black pencils - ridiculous.\\nNot a well made product! It developed a hole after 1 use in the pool and it wasn\\'t over-inflated. Very disappointed\\nBox was torn\\nToo expensive for a small puzzle.\\n\"Reset button doesn\\'t work, change it always getting stuck. Poor design.\"\\n\"Very disappointed.  I couldn\\'t get a tight fit onto the hose, none of the balloons filled up all the way, and you have to throw them pretty hard for them to even pop.\"\\nNot what I expected..too small n their fuzzy n cheap\\nPin broke off in less than one month.\\nWay to cheap looking for the price.\\nmiss Piggy\\'s arm is sewn down. Disappointing!\\nThis toy worked for a grand total of 5 minutes. The darts were fired ONE TIME ONLY prior to ceasing to work. Very disappointing to a 6 year old boy who anxiously awaited its arrival.\\nThe tail broke off sooooo soon!My dad super glued it twice but it still came off.I was not impressed.I suggest only using it for displaying.I as a HUGE mlp fan was very unhappy with this toy.\\n\"Did not work, waste of money.\"\\nwaste of money......dont ever buy again\\nDoesn\\'t look like a tutu it looks like a thin see threw cheap material skirt . I ordered the red color\\n\"Ordered four. All packages were opened and resealed. The Fluffy Baby Shopkin was not in any of the packages. They were swapped out with defective figures (missing facial features, scratched, etc.). I don\\'t know who was more ticked off, me or my girls. Also see Aug. 8th and 9th reviews.\"\\nThis float is terrible. It\\'s nothing like the picture. The sun shade doesn\\'t stay up at all and the mesh &#34;seat&#34; is so unsupportive my baby was neck-deep in the water.\\nVery disappointed so was my grandson!\\nIt did not work with the Identiflyer I bought last year. Had to return it.\\n\"Do not waste your money.  First, many (3-4 per bunch) already had holes in them.  Second, many popped while adding water. Third, after adding water, water was squirting out of the balloons while we were putting water in the others. We only were able to use maybe half of them.  Would not buy again.\"\\nWas broke when I received it.\\nin one month the engine faild\\nnot what i expected at all- way overpriced\\nFalse picture never ordering from toysmith\\n\"While the concept is awesome, don\\'t buy these if your child has curly hair!!!! We are still brushing them out hours later!! I\\'m so mad I\\'m taking these back (I bought them  at target) I noticed the WARNING On the box in tiny letters on the back  &#34;keep away from hair may be entangled&#34; Please don\\'t buy these because KIDS will be kids and do whatever they can to use them creatively no matter what the warning label says\"\\n\"Would give 0 stars if I could. Knockoff bootleg, came in with a terrible paint job and completely broken off wing. After weeks I finally got my refund of hundreds of dollars. You should be ashamed selling bootlegs like these.\"\\n\"These arrived today and I immediately took them out of the box to play with the kids. Upon inspection, it was clear that these were not the quality I thought I was getting. We just spent a week on vacation playing with a set of dominoes that we borrowed from the activity center at our timeshare, and I\\'m almost certain they were the same brand. I got these because I thought they would be the same type with a similar quality. They weren\\'t at all. The others were heavier. I don\\'t know what the material was, but it had a different sound when you clinked them. These were clearly some sort of hard plastic. I can\\'t describe it...they\\'re just different, lighter, and don\\'t seem to be as high quality.<br /><br />I could have lived with that, but what I couldn\\'t live with was the missing corners chipped off on some of the pieces, and the paint on the side that would give away which domino it was (like having a marked card). The lesser complaints include the following: The paint job on some of the dots was bad. For instance, some were painted outside the dot, some were supposed to be orange but a portion of the dots on that suit were faded like watered down paint, and some had a different color on part of the dot than what was supposed to be on there. Also, my OCD got the better of me staring at a double twelve with one dot clearly smaller than the rest. These lesser complaints I could\\'ve let slide had the other dominoes not been chipped. But since we\\'re talking about quality here, I thought I\\'d mention it for the sake of full disclosure for anyone else wanting details on quality.<br /><br />I\\'m very disappointed in this set. The only silver lining is that they refunded my money and I don\\'t have to ship them back. I guess I\\'ll let this be the kids\\' set and not be too worried if they end up chipping more, but I will still need to purchase a better quality set for us adults.\"\\nI can buy the set of figures to make this figure...for $129.00 plus have 6 more figures...\\nIt\\'s a very confusing game and not something I would recommend to younger children. I think we have played it twice. It was painful.\\nCheaply made. Water bottle holder already fraying and strap already halfway separated.\\nOverpriced for the value.\\nWas a gift that stopped working on day 2...wouldn\\'t recommend.\\n\"I purchased this kit mostly for the inflatable swords. All the other items were a bonus, I expected the patches to not be so great from the other reviews so I ordered other ones. I wanted the tattoos for a play &#34;tattoo parlor&#34; we setup at the party. But they were very cartooney and kiddie looking. I\\'m glad I purchased other rub on tattoos because none of the kids chose these, they ended up in the garbage.<br /><br />As for the swords, the kids loved them but they didn\\'t last long. Kids chased each other play fighting with them. By the end of the party more than half of them were broken. As for the hats and &#34;prize&#34; sack, nobody used the hats and the sack was garbage.<br /><br />Your better off making homemade swords with pool noodles. If you look it up online you will find plenty of ideas. Maybe you can even setup a &#34;blacksmith&#34; shop and make it a game for the kids to make their own play swords.<br /><br />If my review helped you make a decision please click the button. : )<br />Thank you.\"\\nNothing like it was described. Cheaply made.\\nVery cheaply made. Smelly and left a nasty residue on our hands. (Washing them helped some with that.) When you squeeze them it puffs out a thin balloon-like bubble. I\\'m sure they will break eventually. (The loop on top of one of them broke in less than a minute.) Wish I had purchased koosh balls instead. The kids do enjoy playing with them though.\\n\"Seat ripped off one side after 1 use, total crap buy\"\\nMight as well buy Kindle. Apps cost too much\\nSucks. They\\'re not even the Pokémons that are in the pic.\\nMonkeys didn\\'t hatch. Very disappointing.\\nI think my POP figure is factory defect or maybe I am so lucky I got a RARE one of a kind Brotherhood of Steal Deathclaw edition. Oh look a figure that I wanted and bought for 10 dollars is magically 34 dollars! Yay!\\n\"These pieces LOOK great, but my son was very disappointed that they don\\'t actually TURN on the Lego tanks he made with them.  We will be returning them.\"\\n\"The package arrived late (its final expectancy date was 4 days ago, it arrived today) and some of the seams are poorly sewn. Plus the loop is too thick for my keys (i bought a set of 24 pieces, the one that comes with their own display box and red plush holding thing right here off amazon, literally just search Lucy\\'s keys) so to put them on the silver loop i need a smaller brass one (came with the big key set). The amount of keys i can fit in is crazy limited and even then they don\\'t fit in so comfortably. Not the best purchase... Sorry\"\\nI tried two of them and one motor went bad.\\nReturned\\nThese are not as advertised . Keeps repeating same couple of phrases when interacting.. Not worth $\\n\"Had to return this disgusting costume. I paid for a NEW costume, I received a USED, linty, smelly, costume with strand of long hair stuck in the Velcro.\"\\nOrdered this product received the incorrect item\\n\"I thought I was getting a captains hat, this is some kind of joke hat. Hat was cheap, but with the freight, not so cheap.  Waste of time and money.\"\\n\"It\\'s a flimsy board.  Also, if you want to learn to play chess, learn to play chess the right way from the beginning.  Not a good buy.\"\\nSeam split in 3 days. Normal use.another  intex ripoff. Don\\'t waist your money\\nTotal waste of money. Hard to break open and look mostly like old chunks of cement\\n\"This could be a great toy, but the execution is just awful. Cheap, and the pieces don\\'t stay together. Plus, you need to buy more than one boxful in order to make any of the interesting design ideas. Do not buy. Stick with Legos and buy some gears.\"\\n\"its impossible to hover, dont get live feed from the camera, the plastic is actually paper and if you go too high, you can cut the power but it will still stay where it is. after 10 seconds it will come down but hard, probably 5 feet per second. you can give it full power but that wont stop you from thinking that itll never start again\"\\n\"They were not 24&#34; in diameter as expected, but were closer to 18&#34;. They deflated quickly, some within a day. They are not round. I\\'m writing this review to confirm what others have posted as I observed the same issues.\"\\nBroke the first day we got it!\\nMeat Balls did not turn out well and the noodles. The kids were disappointed how it turned out\\nnot what i expected\\nThe description did not include &#34;miniature&#34; I was trying to order a real typewriter. I order ribbon to refill it. Now I have ribbon for an old typewriter but no typewriter.\\nVery cheaply made and overpriced. The stand falls apart and has to be reassembled after every &#34;stomp&#34; and the wing nut used to aim just spins without ever tightening. The plastic tubing split after about 20 stomps rendering the whole thing useless. The only good thing is the rockets went high and straight the few times it was used before it fell apart.\\nLook up Pie Face - Hasbro - now for sale for $19.95 - Will start shipping October 1st!!!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-B7063-Pie-Face-Game/dp/B00Y8YO2HG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439326517&sr=8-1&keywords=pie+face+game+by+hasbro\\n\"Not at all happy with this! The spider in the picture is NOT what I received. The picture showed a brown spider. Mine came black and is not as large as the one pictured, only 24&#34;. Mine is very cheap looking. Also, the batteries were dead and even after replacing them the eyes flash so low you can barely see them. Description says two AA batteries but it\\'s actually two lr44 batteries. Would not take a chance on this guy if I were you.\"\\nNot great. Seat ripped out in the two that I had. Didn\\'t take much. Will not buy again.\\nWhat a total waste of money. Arrived bent and torn and cheap terrible quality. Never again.\\nVery cheap necklace it break the next day but pendant was nice and heavy\\n\"Maybe the fact that I am 80 years old makes me ineligible to use this toy.  I was surprised when I turned the cube and they all fell out--so it wasn\\'t until I read the other reviews I realized they\\'re supposed to fall into the box?  Not sure yet.  Anyway, the wood is very cheap and rough--this won\\'t do for my darling 2-year-old ggdaughter.\"\\nThis is sooooo small and flimsy!\\nZipper did not work :( and I had to return it.\\n\"The arms and legs fall off SUPER easily. The toys are TINY. The paint job is shoddy, which would be tolerable, except it\\'s SUCH low quality that it literally has worn off of the toys in just the week my son has had them. Absolutely spend your money elsewhere. This is not worth it. I would never ever have purchased them if I had known how terrible they were.\"\\nThe biggest piece of junk I have purchased to date. It fell<br />Apart immediately and became unusable. I would love to be contacted by the company but they haven\\'t stood by their products at all\\nI don\\'t know what I was expecting but these were cheap cardboard/ cardstock cut outs\\nBatteries charged twice then two of them wouldn\\'t get the quadcopter of the ground.  I used the other two for another two charges and they quit as well.\\nIf I could leave zero stars I would. The product that arrived wasn\\'t like what the picture looks like. Instead they were a faded version and different colors and patterns and very flimsy. Don\\'t waste your money!\\nThe color: they only have white color and the hood doesn\\'t open just the core and rear. I expect more for the price.\\n\"Stamps came and were very dry, could barely see the stamp.\"\\nVery disappointed... I think the product was defective or something because as soon as I filled up the balloons... all the water came back out of them! Big waste of money! My boyfriend actually filled up the rest and then individually had to tie the rubber band around each balloon again... it was a desperate measure to have water balloons for a Water Fight birthday party that was about to start. Someone brought over another brand of these to help save the day and there was no problem at all... they worked perfectly. Not these though. :(\\n\"item had no new tag on it or invoice enclosed.  just stuff item with no indication of tag or purchase, looks like a carnival stuff toy. would not recommend. paid to much for quality. should have gone to target\"\\n\"The Shopkins we received were all the wrong colors. They are on the lists, but not the same color as the ones on the list. Leads me to believe they are fake.  My daughter has taken to calling them her &#34;Fakekins&#34;.\"\\n\"I bought it to my daughter 3 years ago and it was a great present, I decided to give it to my niece for her birthday and after a week stop working, I was very embarrassed... Now I will have to buy another one.\"\\nI didn\\'t experience an order but I too have issues with paradise galleries. The quality is crashing and returns are hard to get done. The language barrier and fake names of representives is almost impossible  The materials are cheaper than ever and sewing on dolls is sloppy  Cotton stuffing is dirty in the arms and legs. I removed the wire in baby Kate and discovered the dirty stuffing hiding in arms and legs. I wrote a review on it and it wasn\\'t printed. Paradise galleries is trying to pass off poor quality for high prices. They are loosing me as a customer and I expect many more customers  will they learn and correct the problems I doubt it. It seems they only want out money.\\nSounds didn\\'t work.\\nTerrible!  Will not stay together during battle.  My grandson was very disappointed.\\n\"What a peice of junk, noisy and not at all like the original, literally fell apart in my hands, a cheap knock off of the original, don\\'t be fooled by this nightmare, insist on the original Sorcery Shop Brand.  ITR is also a trademark of Sorcery Shop, this product is infringing on that mark.\"\\nRoots never appeared. I probably don\\'t have a green thumb.\\nThe &#34;best nerf fun ever&#34; isn\\'t that. When I purchased the blaster I put brand new Duracell batteries in it. Loaded up the brand new darts in the clip and revved the engine. Pulled the trigger and wow I was disappointed. It jammed. Opened the jam door got the dart out and tried again. Did the same thing about 8 times with the same result. I thought maybe it was just the clip so I swapped it out with a brand new 18 round clip that I purchased in addition to the blaster for extra ammo. It fired but once again I was disappointed. The darts went a whole 20 feet MAX. (Not 75). So I returned it because the clip it came with doesn\\'t even work.\\nVery cool idea -- but a big fail.<br /><br />We got it to work at first (lucky to be one of the few with a supported device). Tricky to get it to recognize and accept the photos which is the main purpose -- build creations that then appear on screen with the app game/town.<br /><br />However the app stopped loading and only ever gives error messages now. Did LEGO just stop support after selling these?\\nTail snapped off quickly and would definitely be a choking hazard for younger children.\\n\"Ordered what I thought was going to be the Deathclaw funko pop; however, I received the Lone Wanderer. Guess I should have read the other reviews before ordering.\"\\n\"Gorgeous, but a piece of junk. Poorly engineered, started losing air on the first use. Completely deflated now and I\\'ve only had it in the water a few weeks. Also, the hood assembly doesn\\'t stay in place without contorting the base. Very uncomfortable! Waste of money.\"\\nPlugs  don\\'t match my Blackout\\n\"Too small, animals bent and would not stand. My son was displeased. :-(\"\\n\"I pre-ordered the vault boy and received the ghoul instead. When I pre-ordered, both the description and picture were of  the vault boy. Looks like I will be receiving the mutant instead of the brotherhood of steel figure as well if the same thing happens with it...\"\\n\"Great looking gun, jams constantly. Spend all of your time fixing, while losing all your battles. The design is not perfect, but it needs to perform precisely to shoot. This is by far the worst Nerf gun.\"\\n\"broke first day I had it, and it took almost 2 months to get it, lame\"\\n\"This product was absolutely awful, nowhere on this product page does it state that you need to retain the boxes for DC deckbuilding game to be able to use this product. By the time you would actually be looking for said product you probably have all of Heroes\\' Unite, Forever Evil and other expansions which this product will not be able to hold by itself. Having tried to put expansions in this box I found it fits only 1 expansion at a time not the additional 3 stand alone or 2 Crisis addition packs, so you would need to order multiple copies of this just to have slightly better storage space than what Cryptozoic already provides in the boxes.\"\\nI order this for my 12 yr old son and it didnot last 30 days. I am disappointed with this item. Maybe a smaller child will get better usage.\\nFlimsy broke on first use\\n\"An absolute piece of garbage.  The product never came close to working, tried changing the batteries and it was the same terribleness.  Avoid buying at all costs.\"\\nI bought a bunch of handheld toys for a long road trip.  The other toys worked great. This one never worked even with a change of batteries.  I felt bad for my daughter as she watched her brothers enjoy their new toys.  Thank goodness I packed back up items in case this didn\\'t work.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing and that is why I prepared myself accordingly with back up batteries and other toys.  I gave it a star because I couldn\\'t give it no stars.\\nThe balancer itself is out  of balance out of the box.\\nit just didn\\'t work.\\n\"The quick change doesn\\'t work, even with adults trying to make it work.\"\\nunfortunately the pod is missing the menu not complete and the parts inside pack\\nThe arm completely detached within 2 minutes of my son playing with it.\\nVery disappointed with this product.

If I could give it 0 stars I would.\\nBrought this for my Grandson he has only had it for 2 weeks and already broke not happy because the price I paid for it\\n\"Overpriced, deceptively shown and described.  Will probably return.\"\\n\"If your idea of a good time is spending an entire week working on a 1000-piece Springbok puzzle and finding out the company held back ONE SINGLE PIECE either as a sick joke or a sadistic study of consumer rage... GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS PUZZLE!  When you complain to the company, they will laughingly offer you a duplicate of the same puzzle, absolutely free. HA-HA!  &#34;You\\'re not happy with this lemon?  How about another lemon, sucker?&#34;\"\\nI got a feral ghoul like everyone else on here. BOO!\\n\"They are not as pictured, there are 7 different animals pictured, I only received 3 different ones, 6 blue, 3 green, & 1 red.  They were packed nicely, all in individual clear plastic packages.  However, when I opened them they smelled horrible, a terrible, strong, chemical odor.  I threw them in the trash, and then took the trash outside.  For the money I paid it was not worth that odor in my home, to keep them until I could get a package and deal with shipping them back.  I honestly have a small headache from the smell.  I have a set of these that I got from a local store but they don\\'t carry them anymore and I wanted another set for our summer home.  The ones I got from the local store were like the picture, all different and no smell.  I wouldn\\'t use the ones I received around any child or adult for the odor might make them sick.\"\\n\"looks like a full size bucket but it is not.  only about 3 inches high.  oh well, should have read the other review before i bought it\"\\nClaw broke the first week my grandson had it.\\nDONT BUY<br />this is a knockoff of the real moyu sticker less cube I read the reviews but I didn\\'t believe them yet I still bought it and when it came it was fake don\\'t buy\\nNot even spelled correctly only one r people\\nNot what we expected.

I have had trouble and lost control both time I flew it.  I followed instructions and watch multiple online videos before flying it.

It took my 6 hours of searching to find it.<br />I had someone else who had years of experience try and same thing happened.  He says it is either problem with remote or drone itself.

The strings are very cheap quality (already unraveling) and do not stay in tune. Chords also cannot be played in tune because the top (zero) fret is raised too high and so anything played on the first fret is always out of tune. Very frustrating for young aspiring musicians and their parents who have to listen to out-of-tune playing...

Unfortunately it doesn\\'t work.\\n\"All 4 packs worked like a charm on my Nano QX fpv. Follow the directions (charge batteries before use) and you shouldn\\'t have any problems. Haven\\'t done a flight time comparison to the Blade battery. But I\\'m having fun since I have 5 batteries to fly with and rotate in between. Will buy more once these start losing it\\'s charge capabilities.  Update: after about 15-20 cycles, I\\'m noticing shorter run time. Still charges (using the Blade USB charger) and works. Also, I used the velcro strips included with the batteries to help keep the batteries snugly in the QX. Doing so, created too much stress on the black plastic caps. 2 have come unglued from pulling them out of the quad. Be extra careful not to pull on these caps. Push them out from the backside.  Update #2: ordered another set of 4. Recharged and did a comparison against the original Blade 150mAh 25c battery. I noticed a huge difference in performance. With the Lectrons, the Nano QX FPV lacks the power draw, to recover on a sharp turn+yaw. With the Blade battery, it does great at sharp turns and produces more power to recover. Excuse my lack of proper terminology. I\\'m new to this. I\\'m my opinion, these are good for easy, calm flights. If you\\'re looking to push the Nano, these will not do the Nano justice. I\\'ll be ordering the Blade batteries once these die.  Update #3: won\\'t be buying anymore of these. ALL 8 batteries are virtually out of juice after only about 15+/- cycles. Proper charging on Eflight 4 port charger with the Eflite AC adapter. The Nano QX automatically immobilizes your quad before it drains the battery completely, so I know I haven\\'t pushed the batteries beyond their minimum discharge. The most these are capable of doing is lift the Nano around the living room once and descends.... yes, on ALL 8 Electrons! Changed 5-stars to 1 star. Don\\'t buy.\"\\nThe item arrived but the record and playback function was broken and did not work at all... we tried replacing the batteries but it still remained silent.  Very disappointed as I bought this to replace one my daughter had that had broken.

The small plastic parts break easily, and my son, who is a Lego whiz, struggled with the poor directions. Once we had the thing assembled, we dropped the car about 4 inches and the wheel broke off - as in, the cheap plastic cracked and it was done for. The solar panel never charged either. Tears.

The inside is empty except for a couple of chairs that it comes with and the wheels squeak horribly when my son pushes the truck around.

That was a Huge disappointment.\"\\nBroke the first day items durability was weak if had the opportunity would not recommend or repurchase.\\n\"Unbelievably bad assembly design, but that could have been tolerated EXCEPT the axles were all too short.  The rear was corrected by grinding some bushings. The left front was addressed by brute force- the right front was impossible-  at least 1/2&#34; short and no way to stretch or grind.  Since I needed something that would work for at least a short time I had to drill the chassis so the bushings would be allowed to seat further in. This eventually caused the bushings to get lost in the innards of the chassis. But finally I got the top hat to stick  to the end of the axle and I quickly attached a plastic cover piece in the hope that it would last a couple of hours.<br />Advice -- don\\'t try it!!!!\"\\n\"Zero stars. The clay was dried out and unusable. We are normally very happy with this brand, but this was a complete disappointment.\"\\nSizing was all wrong. It was way bigger than description which made it impossible to wear.\\n\"Judging by the other reviews, some got lucky by getting what they actually bought. Unfortunately I was one of the unlucky majority who got the non-standard battery. It barely fits in the battery compartment, it felt like I was going to break the connectors and electronics while shoving the battery into the tight fit. Then came the real disappointment: this battery is too thick and does not allow the cover to close.\"\\n\"Doesn\\'t work, horribly frustrating for our 4 year old. Arrows broken within the first day.

This toy poses a serious choking hazard. The sounds of this thing also annoyed the crap out of my husband who was rejoicing when I finally tossed it in the trash.\\nWorst product ever. Broke in less than hour. My kids cried so went to the store to replace it (aka buy a new one) and that one broke the same day too. What a waste of money.\\n\"Boring, to easy for my two year old.

Definitely a choking hazard for younger children.\\npoor quality\\nI used this one time and it never stayed inflated. Very disappointed.\\nThese balloons are a cheep knockoff.  Bought three bags of them.  Several of the bunches were made incorrectly and wouldn\\'t even fill.  After you fill them the ties aren\\'t tight enough so all the balloons leak. You can slide the rubber tie up the neck of the balloon stop the leaking but you have do this on each one which is a pain.  When you throw them the rubber bands come off in the air because they aren\\'t tight enough.  Not like the original pack that we bought which had clear ties that worked very well.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy this product again. I hope they find a different manufacture for this product.\\n\"This toy looks like it should be great, and it almost is, but it has quite a few design flaws or perhaps just poor manufacturing.  The gray pieces stick together well, but the small blue hinges pop out abruptly causing the whole assembly to fall apart and the robot cannot be built.  It just won\\'t hold together even for a minute.  Also the gears connecting the gyroscope to the wheels do not engage, so when the gyroscope is running (which is pretty cool), the wheels do not turn and the “robot” does not move.  This was a very disappointing gift that we are returning, because it just does not work, in spite of several skilled people trying.\"\\nSmaller than envisioned. Looked too cheap to use for purpose ordered.\\nTotal of 8 pieces for tire mounting. You either have to glue the outer hard surface to the soft plastic piece that goes around the rim or deal with them sliding off.\\nThis balloon looked great in the package.

There are product lists that reflect the coloring is wrong as well.\"\\nVery messy- greens were falling off the trees.\\n\"The power failed after five uses. Initially it worked reasonably but kept clogging because the nozzle is much smaller than the material fed into it. the nozzle is too small, the filaments come out hairline thin, which isn\\'t good for model making, and the material will bottle neck inside the pen because the nozzle is too small.

This thing seems like a fire hazard with oil, piles of rubber bits and friction. I have it on the counter of my extra bathroom and there is rubber shreds in the sink, on the mirror and floor and all over the tumbler and motor. It also does not roll very smoothly and is loud. After this first (and last) tumble I am throwing it away. On the other hand, I am very happy with the Lortone (double barrel). Better quality, quiet and no mess.

It did not even last for a full day.  After an hour or so, it would no longer reverse.  We thought it was  because the battery was running down, however, even after fully re-charging the battery, it still won\\'t reverse.

Fortunately, the seam that burst was on the tail-end, and I was able to zip tie off the water tube that led to it - this kept the rest of the water sprinklers pressurized.

I have a 12&#34; balloon with me at home, this is less than half the size of the 12&#34; balloon. Very disappointing. More over there are 25 pink balloons and rest all are 8 or 9 of each color, 1 white and 2 brown.\"\\n\"I bought this cover as it was recommended for the pool we bought.

Bought them for a charity project and my family of four only managed to salvage 4 of them from the 48 sold after several hours of effort.  They were not just tangled, they were COMPLETELY KNOTTED purposefully in ways almost impossible to imagine. They must have either been made in a sweat shop where the workers\\' hands would be cut off if there were any discrepancies in the number or weight delivered, thus the correct amount was indelibly knotted together, or else made by poor people who disdained rich consumerist Americans spending money on such junk. Make your own out of recycled cardboard and thread.\"\\nit came with the middle wood divider broken =(\\nCheap and small\\nWorthless\\nPlease do not purchase these. So dissapointed. Bought them for our 7 hour plane trip and couldn\\'t even use them because they didn\\'t work at all and  we couldn\\'t hear anything in them the sound wasn\\'t even audible. They look great but are not practical at all. Pay the extra money and get nice ones for the kiddos if you want them to be able to enjoy their device.\\nThe bucket / scoop is plastic.. The description said it was all metal. When the kids use it in the sand it bends and flexes its just a matter of time till the bucket/scoop breaks.\\n\"Just like many others who have posted, one wash in the Dishwasher and I ended up with Blank Glasses.

When I received this product 3 days late, it was open and all messed up.\"\\n\"I bought this the first time, took it to the beach, and not even a brawny policeman could get it to close.  Ordered a replacement chair, and the first time we pushed the button to fold up the chair, the button broke off.  Cute but complete piece of garbage.\"\\nPiece of junk\\n\"This tank is far too small for a betta. Bettas require at least 2.5 gallons of water, as well as a heater and a filter. They also need hides, which this tank does not provide. Please don\\'t put a betta in this size tank, it\\'s really really not humane. If you want to get your child a good gift that will teach him or her to care properly for animals, I would recommend starting with a 5 or 10 gallon tank with a betta and a few snails in it. He or she will be happy to see the fish enjoying all of the space it has, and will also learn proper care for animals.\"\\nHere\\'s the facts it does not work on water as advertised.

It is so flimsy that each piece your child places will cause any assembled pieces to come apart. Despite the frustration level, my son\\'s love of Mickey and newly discovered masochism spurs him to ask to do this puzzle several times a day. He stubbornly talks his way through the picture looking for the next piece as I attempt to hold his work together until the exercise mercifully ends. At that moment there is no trace of his usual sense of pride at the end of puzzle, just mutual relief that we can move on to something more fun. I know he will go back to the well again though, with only the optimism that a 3 year old can muster hoping next time it will be better. I bought this at the Dollar Store not knowing that my bargain was actually a deal with the devil. Don\\'t make the same mistake.\"\\nCame with a defective compartment.  B/c I ordered in spring but didn\\'t open until June--I couldn\\'t exchange it b/c it exceeded 30 days.  Disappointment.\\nThese are horrible!  Won\\'t fit an adult to use as a teaching tool. Cheap. Parts falling off by just touching them\\nModeling clay included was dried up. Unfortunately didn\\'t open this gift until after 30 days of ordering so no returns.\\nThis gun sucks it don\\'t work stay with nerd\\nBroke almost immediately\\nI hate this bed! It\\'s NOT easy to put together by ANY means and it\\'s a cheap piece of crap!\\n\"Worst item ever ordered on Amazon. The handle was thin fishing line, broken & beads all over the place. Very very dangerous for a toddler. The tin case was dented. I just threw it out, as returning would have cost me money. Not at all what I had expected & will be more careful in the future.\"\\n\"Maybe I made a mistake in filling the balloons a couple of hours earlier than when the kids were going to play with them, but by the time they wanted to use them, all the water had come out of them and they were all 1&#34; in diameter. It sounds like a very cool idea but in reality they did not work at all for me and my money was wasted.\"\\n\"This toy isn\\'t very \\'safe\\' for small children. The head us easy to separate from its body and if pushed wires can be seen. I was really disappointed by the quality but I will say that an older child, says seven or eight, would probably really enjoy this. Seven dollars is acceptable to pay or less the plastic us solid bit the \\'neck\\' attachment is not. A headless doll would probably last generations.\"\\n\"Do NOT buy this!!  Goes through size C batteries constantly, and my son doesn\\'t even play with it that often.  The gun will only work when batteries are fresh and new.  Batteries that are running out of juice aren\\'t able to power the gun and make it work properly.  Really disappointing...my son spent his own money to buy this garbage and now he wants to spend more money buying batteries.  And did I mention that it jams constantly?  Horrible product.\"\\n\"After reading the reviews, I assumed this would be easy to assemble without much difficulty.  First, the directions are vague, but if you look at the photo and use a little logic, it makes sense.  HOWEVER, right off the bat, our big main pieces didn\\'t line up, throwing everything else off.  Since it\\'s lightweight balsa wood, too much pressure is going to splinter and break the pieces.  So after twenty minutes of attempting to assemble the first three pieces (while my nine year old quickly lost interest), I put the pieces back into the bag and walked away.  Pretty much a waste of $12.00 for what should have been a neat little birthday present.  :(\"\\n\"While my niece loved it, it was far, far too light to be able to use :( This would be wonderful for someone younger than she is, she is nine\"\\nDid not fit properly and canopy would not stay up\\nI got in like in 3 weeks Then in one day it stopped working\\nMisleading. It\\'s four trays of exactly the same colors on all four trays. They are not good quality. Should have just sucked it up and re-ordered my RoseArt 100 pack. Lesson learned.\\n\"Very disappointed, only came with 1 dozen, not the 2 dozen as shown in product description.\"\\nCards were not as advertised - included none of the God cards. None of the cards in the photo were sent.\\nI ordered the panda and got the cat!\\nCheap\\n\"Very cheesy and the hanging toys are a very hard plastic.  Also, the top faces at a funny angle so you can\\'t see the face of it when the baby is laying underneath it.  It\\'s either they can reach the hanging toys or they hang see the face of it while the toys dangle around their waist\"\\n\"Warning! !! Do not purchase this produc.  The first day that I used the float it leaked .Not only that ,I had to blow it up myself. It did not come with aI device to inflate the float with. Plus it took me over 2 hours to blow it up. I\\'m surprised I didn\\'t hyperventilate and pass out. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.\"\\n\"Bought it as a gift, charge last 8 minutes, disappointing for our son, bought it a month before opening the box , too late too return.\"\\nAfter 2 runs 3 of 4 screws are lost. It doesn\\'t worth it!\\n\"This item was awful.  When we opened the box, the wheel fell off.  My supervisor opened the 2nd one and touched the wheel twice before it went flying.  We are going to ask someone to drill and attached a longer screw to hold this together.\"\\n\"This container is too small for a live animal. Definitely don\\'t buy this container though, unless you want to keep some cool looking rocks (and nothing else) in it.\"\\n\"Saddle and bridle fit two different size horse toys. Both are way too small to fit AG (18&#34; doll) accessory horses, despite what the current description said. We returned this.\"\\nThe truck looks and feels terribly cheap. It almost looks like a Tonka knock off.  The stickers are faded and two are crooked.  My sons $6 little 5 inch fire engine looks and sounds better. I would had returned it had I not needed it for a gift.\\nstopped working after 1 week\\nIt is made out of foam and the packaging caused me to break it before we even got to use it.\\nVery cheap\\nCheap cards RIP OFF!\\nI have not bought this product yet. But was interested in purchasing it. By my calculations the smaller size Play-Doh (141g / 5oz @ $4.49 to $5.06) is either cheaper or the same cost of buying this in bulk (6lbs / 2700g @ $89.99 - $109.99).  Worse yet the 5oz is available on Prime and the 6lb isn\\'t. So that extra $8 shipping eats up any potential cost savings. The 1 star rating is simply on the price. I love Play Doh. But this purchase makes no economical sense. I saw the 6lbs and got all excited. I was very disappointed after doing the math. Hasbro we have calculators too!\\nThis is a stupid joke.\\n\"Unfortunately, we bought two of these items and could not get either of them to work. They are very delicate and break easily. Definitely not work the $50 price tag. Unfortunately, my grandkids tore the packages up on Christmas day and they were thrown out, so I could not return the items.\"\\n\"This is highly priced for what you get.

Plus, some of these experiments don\\'t even allow you to activate the gyroscope - they\\'re basically just crude, non-working models.<br /><br />To top off this disappointment, the holes in the plastic of the gyroscope that pins must be inserted into are weak, and inserting the pins into one of these quickly displayed white, stressed areas that then left the pins pushed in beyond the point that they could be removed or secure parts any longer.

Basically your kid scratches off black dried ink to reveal the pictures.  Where does that ink end up?  Everywhere!  It has stained so many things in our household and my son\\'s stroller and his hands.  Basically, the only way to use this book is to have your child use it outdoors and then to get him or her right into the bath.  Way too much drama.

I would definitely not buy these again and would not recommend them at all.\"\\nAlthough I knew that this keyboard was slightly used when I ordered it only worked for a couple of weeks before it completely stopped working.\\nBought this for my son who is absolutely obsessed with trains.

What a waste!  What\\'s the point of an on/off switch when it doesn\\'t work?\"\\n\"Do not spend the money on this product, unless you intend to use it indoors only. I can\\'t believe Disney would allow its branding on such a cheaply made product.  The price was reasonable but still does not reflect the quality of the product.\"\\n\"The paper value for the cards in this set is 100-120 dollars depending. Most of the other 2011 sets sell much closer to their real value. For some reason this set is almost 100 dollars more. I have no idea why. Kaalia is worth about $30, or $60 if you get her in the Commander Arsenal set. The rest of the good rares are worth about 6 dollars, and then it goes to about a dollar a card or less.<br /><br />I understand sellers are trying to make a profit. They deserve to profit, but the markup on this set is 100% of normal.<br /><br />Just get Devour for Power, Counterpunch, Mirror Mastery, or Political Puppets, and skip this.\"\\nVery Cheap. Destroyed in 5 minutes.\\nI gave the candle to my niece for her kids birthday party...it did NOT work.....did not open up as stated or spin or play happy birthday....was a huge disappointment.

Not the quality that I expected given the price.  Won\\'t be getting these again.\"\\nCheap plastic and flimsy. I do not recommend this product for the approximate $80 price tag.\\n\"This cost $20, but it is made out of cheap plastic and the jacks are huge.  This is a rip off.\"\\n\"Very cheaply made compared to other Iron Man masks that I\\'ve seen in stores for the same price.  There is only an elastic string to hold the mask on compared to other masks which have a thicker velcro strap.  Also, there is no &#34;padding&#34; to make it more comfortable.  It is only hard plastic.\"\\n\"These were a cheap knock off version, not the original bunch o balloons as advertised.  I have had the original and they were in a different packaging and had a completely different feel to them.  After great success with the original brand, I was nervous as I realized these were not the same as I had before.  My suspicions were confirmed when NONE of the balloons stayed filled.  They did not seal after being filled and therefore immediately emptied.  Every single one of them.  Thankfully, this seller did the right thing and refunded my purchase.  Do not be deceived.  These are not the same as the original.\"\\n\"Side wood panels are made from soft pine and not finished at all.  If you ready to spend some time for wood sanding and staining, then it\\'s ok. Figues are ok, but felt material on the bottom is too thin - need to glue more thick fabric to eliminate unpleasant wood-to-wood clop when you move figures on the desk.<br />I was in good mood and just considered the set as a DIY kit which worth $10. Another time I would just return it back.\"\\nNot a good bubble machine.  Barely worked.

This time the wing tore off :(<br />Is there any way I could get a replacement?\"\\nGlue does not stick at all. Total waste of money. Customer service is very bad. The tattoos did were a waste of time and the kids were upset as they would not stick and peel off right away. I will never buy from them again.\\nHair comes off easily\\nVery disappointing I expected a much bigger truck My grandchild was also disappointed Not worth the price\\n\"This was the biggest ripoff of a kids hard earned money. My son bought this and he received a &#34;instructional &#34; DVD and two thin strips of (tin?) don\\'t really know what they are. He eagerly put the DVD into the player and it was a 30 second video of someone doing the trick, not one second is used to teach how to do.. The only &#34;magic&#34; here was how fast they made my sons money disappear... Save your $$$$ guys on this one...\"\\n\"Super exited to get these in the mail...fun colors. However, not easy to put back together. Little ones become frustrated!!!! Letters are printed on both sides so it is confusing!!!!\"\\n\"I bought these thinking that there would be 10, 13ft long strings of these and there is just one.  I could have bought this same thing at party city for $5.00. Definitely would have been worth the money I spent if there had been 10 of these in the packaging.

It was thin and poor quality, so we returned it.\"\\n\"I returned this to the seller! Nothing wrong with it, my daughter did not like it!\"\\n\"This item is deceitful.  The image clearly shows a box of 48 sticky hands and no where in the description does it show that the price is for 1 hand, but that is what I got.  Extremely disappointed.\"\\nI could not get it to run on wny of my computers.Something about a DLL missing.<br />I have tried everything I can think of  for help. From/ forums /to YouTube /to Microsoft /to trying to get the product company that made it.<br />I have had no luck with any of them.<br />Looks like I just wasted my money.\\n\"Item was easy to blow up, however, it lost air pretty quickly.\"\\n\"Good for beer holder only, not cooler. Lid just sits on top with loose velcro strap that leaves huge gap in top. A little over half bag of ice melted after about an hour in my pond with about 6 cold beers and 3 waters. Beer will start getting warm after about 1.5 hrs. Get one that holds an insulated sealable cooler.\"\\nSo bummed!  I bought this last spring--and left it boxed in our pool room until this summer.  When I went to blow it up--the bowl would not stay inflated--BRAND NEW out of the box!  --AND b/c more than 30 days had passed--I could not exchange it!  Will not make any more purchases from this supplier.  :-(  Wondering how this made it through QC @ the company with an obvious defect???  SUPER disappointed.\\n\"not impressed with this toy... needs to be for child less than 6 months old.. It is much smaller than appears and although very cute, it doesn\\'t provide much stimulation for a baby over 6 months old.<br />NO PACKAGING ON THE ITEM AT ALL! Thrown into a shipping bag and dispatched from China. Odd odor, maybe factory smell.\"\\n\"I am so disappointed that the version that was sent out is not the one pictured. We were sent the new version with flimsy cards, plastic card holders and a flimsy box. We will be sending this back!! Not worth the money. We love all of the older versions of the 10 day games. It\\'s unfortunate that they haven\\'t kept the quality of the older version.\"\\nWould have been a nice puzzle if it wasn\\'t missing a piece.\\n\"Not impressed at all, my package was open and damaged, the table was all scuffed up... Not happy that I had to give it to my daughter looking like I bought it at a second hand store, on her birthday...\"\\n\"I was very excited to receive these toys for my Littles, but I do have a concern about two of them.  The bead balls with the elastic cord -- the elastic is a very thin, about 1/4 inch and not even sewn together, just tied together.  A little mouthing by a baby and that will come apart and the balls then would be loose.  The balls themselves are a good size and doubt would be a choking hazard.  However, the balls on the single rope are smaller and could pose a choking hazard.  The rope/balls rattle again, there is only a knot at each end, not sewn, etc.  I easily pulled it apart and tried to make at least two knots on each end to make it safer but the rope was not long enough.  The wood rattle with wood rings seems very nice and safe.  Sadly, I will be returning the product.\"\\n\"Does not fit! Do not buy, hopefully I can get a refund!\"\\nItem was received quickly. However it was incomplete. Black castle missing.\\nGood luck trying to get this together. Pices are so small very hard to hold on to them while putting it together and directions are very difficult to follow. Have had for a while now and not even 1/4 of the way done with one. We have given up.\\n\"Bought this for my son for his birthday and after charging it for the recommended time, took it outside to get the feel of it.  Get it outside and had trouble getting it to start up unless I was working about 2 ft from it with the remote.  When it did finally take off, it took off for good.  The darn thing kept getting higher and higher until it got to about 100 ft off the ground and just drifted until it was out of sight over a wooded area where I lost sight of it.  It was a total waste of money and now I ha e to spend more money for another gift for my upset son because his gift was lost.  I wouldn\\'t recommend any purchasing this product.  Still waiting on response from Walmart and the company that makes this product.\"\\nThe Company that makes this actually put their company label on the too of a game piece thereby making it known to players what picture was on the reverse side.  How dumb is that?  I returned it.\\nThese things hurt!!! I purchased this for my ten year old nephew and all the kids at the party were crying from how hard the tips were.\\nItem is very small and it does not sit up. I had to place tape on the bottom of it so it could stand up. The kids tried to throw the rings around the flamingo\\'s neck but it was just too hard. Best to just buy products that are not inflatable.\\nI wore them one time and a seam ripped. They are not very comfortable for men.\\n\"Provided several hours of puzzle making time, but 1 piece was missing.  Incredible.  Kind of takes any sense of accomplishment away.  No children or pets in the house.\"\\nThis fell apart within minutes of my kids playing with it.  It has a cheap price but you get what you pay for.\\nSound was not authentic and volume was very weak\\n\"One of the pens didn\\'t work, and the one that did work only worked for an hour.\"\\nThe 2nd jar of caterpillars was cracked with dead caterpillars.\\n\"Piece of junk. The box was taped up and contents packed in such a way that it looked like it had already been returned by someone else. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but I was afraid it would look like I gave them a used gift. I couldn\\'t even donate it to the local toy drive because they only take &#34;new, unopened&#34; gifts.\"\\n\"These are a joke, they are a hazard to young children.  They are so small they are barely larger than the tip of the eraser on a pencil.  I will be returning these...\"\\nSomething is odd if the only reviews are because these people got them free.  Especially if they are mothers of kids that have no idea what they are.\\n\"The Mega Bloks CAT 8252 Car Transporter is JUNK.  The first problem is the truck looks bigger in the picture than it really is.  I didn\\'t look at the dimensions which I probably should have.  The pieces wouldn\\'t fit together so they back end didn\\'t stay on.  This was a gift for a friend\\'s son.  I was very embarrassed giving such a horrible toy to good friends.  Don\\'t buy this!!<br /><br />We were looking for something similar to MEGA BLOKS 652 Caterpillar CAT Tiny \\'N Tuff Constructor.  My son loved it and it was a quality toy.

I had to return it\"\\nI bought this for my almost 3 year old daughter and she was so disappointed. The tail fell off of the puppy and wouldn\\'t stay attached. I even tried to hot glue it and it didn\\'t help at all.

If you try to take off again after landing (without turning it off), it will not respond to controls correctly and flies quickly in a random direction. The wheels are flimsy and don\\'t work well either. Get a Cheerson CX10 instead.\"\\n\"I was disappointed. This doll is very beautiful, but I purchased it to use in a doll cake. It actually looks like a crash test dummy behind the dress. I couldn\\'t  use it for my cake because the elbows, wrists, ankles and  knees. would show and it was creepy. I ended up sending it back and purchased a different one.\"\\nI need the puzzle opening instructions.  I use this for giving money gifts and it is useless to me if I can\\'t open it\\n\"It clearly says on the packaging that it includes 6 cookie cutters, 1 ruler, 1 knife, and 1 extruder. I can\\'t even return this because my toddlers seen me open the package and I didn\\'t have the heart to take it away. I feel completely ripped off. This is a cheap piece of plastic.

I live in Seattle, so it isnt like it gets crazy hot here. Also, the 2-tube system makes these very hard to deflate. Also, this is my bad for not paying more attention, but there no cup holders! Size is good though.\"\\nI ordered this for my son because I had seen this at a friends house and thought it would be a great gift for my 14 month old. It turned out to be a dud! When no one is around the puzzle the fire engine siren will go off repeatedly. When you put the right puzzle in the right spot either it won\\'t make any noise at all or the wrong noise will go off. Very disappointing!\\nThey don\\'t stick to the ear.\\nTerrible quality and very itchy even my girl refuse to wear it\\n\"I have purchased about 20 of the round tubes over the past few years.  Compared to them this is an inferior product.  My friend purchased two of these.  We took them on the river a couple weeks ago.  Halfway through the trip the connection ripped right out of the side resulting in an instant deflate.  The round ones have a rope that goes around them and if you use a carabiner to clip the ropes of two tube together, it spreads the load across multiple points.  On top ot catastrophic failure, the printing wore off underneath the user\\'s thighs after one use.  Have not seen this problem on the round tubes.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know what happened to my review but here goes again. This recent landing gear is a far cry from the original I bought a year ago for the Vision. I recently crashed and the original saved my gimbel (for the most part) meaning that the bar bent but I fixed it. These new ones are very pliable and bend like a straw. I would have completely destroyed my camera.  Keep the stock gears until you can find another manufacturer. Not sure if others make it, but this manufacturer is no good. You can tell the difference by comparing the thickness of the plastic (about 50%).\"\\nIt doesn\\'t work\\nRipped right away.\\nThese are horrible.

How disappointed they were with this garbage when it was all said and done.<br /><br />If you watch the video to set this up, they talk about building it inside of a 4\\'x4\\'space. I don\\'t know about you, but I don\\'t have any rooms in my house that match that space. We set it up in a corner of a room and then used a dresser as a third wall.<br /><br />Setup was extremely cumbersome and finicky.

Added to this we used this kit with another kit which apparently was designed to go the opposite direction (think clockwise vs counter clockwise) and not matter how we tried to arrange them, the zip lines on this toy constantly crossed.

I\\'ve played two full-length games thus far, and I estimate there were maybe three questions total from the past 30 years during those two games (of roughly 35 to 40 questions total per game). The rest were all from 1950-1979. The movie version of Scene It does a good job of mixing up eras and genres, but the TV version seems to be almost exclusively pre-1980, which really misses the mark for those of us in the under-40 crowd.<br /><br />Also: The numbered die is laughably huge--and difficult to roll alongside the category die--for no discernable reason.\"\\nItem recieved but did not come with esc .....not happy as it is suppose to come with one\\nBroke within the first day of use!\\nExtremely disappointed that the product does NOT work!!

I went back to check on the battery and squeezed it because it seemed like it was under pressure. A small opening started spewing some pungent gas out and the battery began smoking. I immediately rushed to the hose to put out the fire. The battery continued to smoke and get worse after dousing it in water. I ran to the yard and tossed the battery on the ground as it was bursting into flames and smoking. It eventually burnt out and was safe to dispose of. Be very careful with this battery, cheaply made and dangerous.\"\\n\"Product will not float with a 50lb child on it. It is useless. I paid too much to just throw it away!

The fact that parts are available to repair this truck is essentially there to lead you to believe that it is hobby class vehicle. It\\'s not!<br /><br />My son recently bought this truck. In three days of ownership we\\'ve had to go to Hobbytown each day for repair or supplies. One of those trips was on us for a mistake we made while running the truck.<br /><br />The supplied wall battery charger is only a 1/2 amp charger. It takes forever to charge the supplied battery. Such a joke. You\\'re immediately forced to buy a $19.99 &#34;quick charger&#34; in order to enjoy running the truck multiple times in one day. We also chose to buy a second battery so my son could run the truck while the other battery charged. To the hobby store we went.<br /><br />Day two, the truck stops running. To the hobby store it goes. Apparently the truck had sucked in dirt and small pebbles through the motor and into the drive gears which eventually jammed the gears up so they wouldn\\'t turn. Thus no response when calling for throttle. This after only about an hour and a half total run time. And 95% on pavement.<br /><br />Next problem, the solder attaching the negative wire to the motor breaks off. Out with the soldering iron for a presumably quick fix. WRONG! The issue is a deeper one as once I solder the wire back on to the motor its continuity is still broken. So now it appears the truck needs a new motor. This motor hasn\\'t run more than 2 1/2 hours tops and it has already broken. Not burned up, but broken!<br /><br />This vehicle is poorly designed and of poor quality. I recommend avoiding Helion at all costs.<br /><br />Next step is to see if Hobbytown will stand behind this pathetic product. Stay tuned!\"\\n\"Just opened this today.  Many of the pieces were still put together.  When  I attempted to break them apart, the paper backing tore and some of the pieces were so stuck they wouldn\\'t come apart.

The shutters pop off frequently. The &#34;slide&#34; is merely a six inch high incline. The assembly took a long time, as you need to put each of the 20some stickers on, and screw in 10+ screws.

The side and back parts of the slide do not squirt water on the slide. Moreover, you need a fairly high pressure water hose for the water to even spray out of the side.\"\\n\"Bought two of these packaged individually for my son and daughter.  My son\\'s (Zombie Shark) stopped working after about 1 hr.  Thought it was the batteries, but tried replacing with new.  Went back the next day to purchase another and ended up buying a four pack (to &#34;save&#34; money).  Big Mistake!  One of them did not work out of the box (Shark 2.0).  Then the Clownfish stopped working within 2 hrs.  Then my daughter\\'s Seahorse stopped working after 1 day (checked the batteries, too).  So doing the math - we purchased a total of 6 of these and now after 24 hrs, only two of them work.  That works out to about a 33% chance what you buy will work more than one day and about only an 80% chance they will work out of the box.  Water gets into the back of the fish and then leaks into the battery compartment sometimes.  They are junk and potentially unsafe - unless you like the idea of your kid playing in water that is in contact with a corroding lithium battery with trace mercury.  Stores will not take them back (because they know they are junk) and the manufacturer will only exchange them (at your shipping & handling expense both ways.  Why would you pay to send and return shipping totaling $12 just for a product that is fatally designed and costs $5-10.  Cute idea; failed execution\"\\nVery upset.

The execution not so much. My wife bought this for our 7year old son as a birthday present. Since I am writing in the I form, I do not need to mention that the 7yr old did not contribute a tremendous amount of work here. I dropped out after about one hour.<br /><br />My background is in electrical engineering, so I can definitely get things to work, when I put some thought into it. I eventually finished putting the beast together. A beast it is as most reviewers already mentioned, the instructions are incomplete, and some parts are missing. I managed to put some live into the beast. However here are a few of the problems I ran into:<br />1.) The assembly took about 5 hours, I basically did it twice, first following the instructions, and then a second time to make it work, I ignored the instructions. I finally had it put together and then I started adjusting and putting things in place. The it worked for a short amount of time.<br />2.) The moving parts rub and grind against each other causing a tremendous amount friction. Parts keep shifting and moving, so every adjustment lasts for only for a few minutes..<br />3.) That bug is heavy. It weight 2lbs, 12 oz. or roughly 1200grams.<br />4.) It uses 3 AA batteries which lasts only a few minutes.<br />5.) The remote control does its own thing, when I lift the beast up, the controls seem to work, but once I put it down, it did what it wanted. I eventually disconnected the distance sensors, that helped a little.<br /><br />In conclusion, the beast is pretty frustrating, I will see if we can build something different with it. the motor, the remote etc. have some value.\"\\nThis &#34;Nerf&#34; gun is very poorly made and did not work right out of the box.

The one I got is cute, but I would not have bought it if I had thought it was only one, especially for almost $10.  I hope this review helps others who might misunderstand the description.

I couldn\\'t return because my 3 year old son was standing waiting to play with the toy.\\nA piece of garbage\\n\"Unfortunately, I had to return this item. The first time it was used the print on the back of the chair came off on my grandsons arms. Refund received with no issues.\"\\n\"Ugg, I wanted to like this blaster.  I forgave it for seeming cheap-o right out of the box because it had the right ideas, it had a cool quirkiness to it that was worthy of praise until the third shot.  That is where everything went awry.  The slim dart pegs by itself seemed abrasive to the darts, but it was the string that split the darts from the back.  Once split, the darts it came with were pretty much useless, even with the slightest tear.  Nerf should have either used some kind of dart-launch protector or used a thicker elastic band so the string doesn\\'t apply it\\'s full force on a tiny fraction of the back of the dart, which is what I believe causes most of the tearing and jamming of the darts.  Amazon gave me the refund, but I still had to repackage and re ship it back to avoid them from charging me again.  In retro-spect, maybe I just had a lemon, but the bottom line is that Nerf should test their products better before shipping it off (this is the 2nd Amazon Nerf refund/resend in a row, an Elite Retaliator needed to be replaced because it froze halfway through priming).  I didn\\'t even get a chance to test the velocity ratings on my chronograph, but on average it should have been in the 60 feet per second range; I just don\\'t know for sure.  An exclusive flintlock-styled 6-shooter I also got from Target using the same technology (Rebelle Charmed &#34;Fair Fortune&#34; crossbow) had the same issues, so now it is looking like the &#34;Stringers&#34; are having serious setbacks by virtue of Elite darts not being designed to be launched by rubber-bands.\"\\nThe box was not in good condition and it was not worth what I paid\\nSucks\\nThey lay flat on the pool bottom. Wuh waaaaaaah\\nThese are incredibly cheap quality. All but one broke during the first round of the race. Not worth the money spent on them.\\nWorse item i have ever purchased from Amazon....Does not work\\nToo small\\n\"This chair was horrible ... one of the floats was dented, the chair reclines way too far in the water.  It wasn\\'t hard to put together but one time in the water was enough to convince us it was useless.  We returned it the next day and ordered and inflatable instead.\"\\nAwful. Peddles come right off every time my daughter tries to ride. We\\'re so disappointed\\n\"This turtle was so S-L-O-W that it barely moved in the pool.  The batteries are a real pain to change out and no matter how tight we make the screws, the batteries get wet and corrode.  We aren\\'t wasting any more batteries on this turtle.\"\\n\"this tube really sucks!! It doesn\\'t even deserve one star..the first tubing trip we went on as soon as we went down it started to deflate!! Good thing my dad brought an extra he bought from academy..I should have got mine from there..they were only $12.99 and you can tell that they were made with a sturdy material, not like these mine had cheap plastic and popped imediently..and it didn\\'t come with the connecting piece to connect to the other tubes. Really disappointing!! Don\\'t buy this!! Just go to a sports and outdoors store they are better. I used my dad\\'s from academy sports and outdoors and it lasted the whole 3 day river trip going down rapids and all!\"\\n\"Does not print real money like everyone says it does. If you think this thing prints real money, you\\'ve been lied to and otherwise think again. We all woulda been rich by now.\"\\nI think it would have made more sense if we had TWO goals. I kept seeing on the review that it said &#34;goals and it had four bags to use to weight the one goal down?  The ball kept deflating as well like the other products we got from this company. Not a happy customer but I guess you get that you pay for.\\njunk.  worked great for about 1/2 bottle of bubbles.\\nThe one received was torn on one of the walls. I returned it.\\n\"No different than regular bubbles, absolutely not worth the money\"\\nI thought this was a real lunch box. But it was more like &#34;you can carry your lunch money in it only&#34; lunch box. Very cute but too small for a lunch.\\nMy pre order now says super Mutant 😕 really disappointing considering I pre ordered the brotherhood of steel before it sold out. Also the vault boy I ordered arrived as a ghoul 😕 super disappointing.\\n\"It\\'s a good idea for a kids show, but I can\\'t get it to NOT ring! The whole joke is that it will ring for me, but NOT my kid-assistant. This works if they are only 3 or 4 years old, but if the child is older or if they really try hard, then the bell still rings! I\\'ve tried so hard to figure out how to make this work, but I just can\\'t come up with anything. Are they all like this? Does anyone have any suggestions?\"\\nI purchased two of these.  One arrived broken and the other worked but couldn\\'t get off the ground.\\nThis is incredibly ridiculously small and nothing that I expected I was paying for.  Sorry just being honest.\\n\"This is a very, very cheaply made toy. The top doesn\\'t stay attached, even when the child is being gentle with it.  It is very small and even if it were built sturdier, a child would lose interest in it quickly. I would not recommend this at all. We\\'ve had it put together for a grand total of ten minutes and we\\'re already trying to figure out how to get rid of it without offending the gift giver.  Edit: Ten minutes later and the pretend temperature knob won\\'t stay on. Seriously. This thing is junk.\"\\nI\\'ve been a heavy Amazon shopper for more than 10 years and never felt compelled to write a review until now.  This toy is a complete piece of garbage. It falls apart so easily that it is impossible to play with.  Don\\'t waste your money.\\nThe ball leaked immediately and the basket tips over all the time.  It\\'s unusable.\\nDidn\\'t really work at all.  Black nozzle shaft pulls out of the entire pump with minimal force.  Useless. Do not buy.\\nI have 3 of these they are not \\'\\'highly collectible at the slightest get ur facts straight&#34;\\n\"I bought this pool from a store by our house.  We were SO excited to set it up for our child...until we noticed a cap that was missing.  The box looked to be factory sealed, so we looked to see if the cap was in the box or on the floor. Nope. :(  The directions were not helpful in determining if this valve was supposed to be left open. I\\'m returning this pool today--without even getting to use it.  Hope that other people have better success with this item!\"\\n\"My son got this as a gift and not only did the robot arm fall off, but it never moved.\"\\n\"Buyer Beware, underhanded shenanagins are going on here! This is NOT the rarer item it claims to be. How can this have a Horror Block Exclusive Sticker when the Horror Block version was a varient of this character in different clothing (white shirt I believe, with blood spatter all over his mouth and clothing...)  Also, why no photo of the special Horror Block sticker on top?  Probably because it isn\\'t there.  The exact figure pictured here came in my Nerd Block, so it should just have a Nerd Block sticker on top, which is also not shown in the photos. I wonder why this special sticker that is supposed to be the whole reason it\\'s SO overpriced, is not even shown in a pic?!  Bait and Switch, people, do your research first...  If you can see the photo I attached, the Nerd Block Version is on the left, and the rarer bloody Horror Block Version is on the right.  Sorry, but true.\"\\n\"If I could leave a -1, I would.  this is NOT anything like the GI Joe as some have said in their reviews.  The hands fall off (yes this comes with more than one hand - to fit the different guns, and they don\\'t stay on well)  On top of that, the doll is skinny, not like a big army guy, and the material is cheap and not sturdy like real GI Joe.  Wish Hasbro would bring back the 12 inch action figures for the boys!  If my grandson had not torn apart the box, I would be returning this for my money back.\"\\n\"if that is jumbo i,d hate to see same  and doug lied to her about jumbo never buy again lies lies\"\\n\"Do not waste your money, the downloadable questions are no longer available. The only way to show your dissatisfaction is to no longer buy Hasbro games.\"\\nThese are very cheap -- fall apart and have sharp edges when they do.\\n\"Disappointing. Good ideA but cheaply made. One worked, one would only go forward, no turning. Kids were disappointed.\"\\n\"The order arrived almost a month late. Experienced only a few minutes the Wallnut, overheated and very quickly. Turned it off, let it cool and never got the call. A real disappointment. I do not advise buying this unit. A shame!\"\\nI haven\\'t gotten round to shipping mine back\\nCheap item. Do not buy.\\n\"These are definitely not Estes blades.  They\\'re just sized differently enough that they are incompatible with Estes blades on the copter, sit too low and hit the body and plus, I got two white A blades in the same package.  The other package had the correct mix but something isn\\'t right because it won\\'t fly.\"\\nI bought one as a gift before that emitted a blood curdling scream. This one is much smaller than advertised and sounds like a chew toy.\\nReturned it because the toy is completely unstable even when adults put it together\\n\"very disappointed in quality of product, three batteries never charges right\"\\nVERY DECEIVING!!!!! Sure the confetti is pretty but 8000pcs sounds like a lot of confetti.  Trust me it is minuscule!  Total rip-off.  Don\\'t buy it.\\n\"We bought this for our son yesterday. After less than a day of use, the gears are already stripped and the car is unusable.\"\\nPlus the item came in with broken accessories.\\nOnly one worked.\\nI bought these for a kids party and none of the tattoos would apply. Several people tried using these tattoos and it didn\\'t work for them either. They\\'re cute but don\\'t work. A waste of money and a disappointment for a group of small kids 3-6 years that wanted the tattoos.\\n\"The time tracker function works fine. The issue is that tracker won\\'t turn off when I no longer need to use it. It just sucks up 2 AA batteries over the course of a week, and then requires replacement of the batteries. Even with rechargeable batteries, this is a nuisance (the battery panel must be removed by phillips screwdriver).\"\\n\"Cheap product, wires for the camera were disconnected from the circuit board. Useless camera now!\"\\nSo bad! Blocks are all NOT the same size - just get the normal version\\nMade the mistake and ordered the micros instead of the regular size.\\n\"Not thrilled. Within minutes of putting on everything, the seams ripped off the knee pads and elbow pads. She didn\\'t even fall. They just ripped open.\"\\n\"It didn\\'t say it was a commander pro box. When I got it, it was huge and looked awkward holding magic cards\"\\nThe rope hoops didn\\'t hold up very well. Not totally pleased with this item.\\nAwful!!! There were broken at the bottom! Very disappointed!!!\\n\"Some parts didn\\'t snap together and those that did didn\\'t stay together.  Very flimsy, some pieces broke taking them out of the packaging.  Extremely disappointing for the price.\"\\n\"the sofa is ok, although the sides are flimsy and have no support for the child. I had to return it. It says it has a removable cover in order to wash or clean it. There is a a zipper that goes round the bottom on three sides. There is no way that it opens. So I thought perhaps it was a defective item an ordered a replacement. Well it cam and the zipper is the same. So it will have to be returned at some point too. Very disppointed.\"\\nI received this item today. The overall build is not good and the product I received appears to be a very old one.. There are visible sign of wear and tear and the product doesn\\'t look clean. Although I can live with that but there is one thing which I wanted to share with everyone. The product is incomplete.<br /><br />The screws and nuts that I receive is incomplete. There is a spacer and screw and nuts to assemble the landing gears to join the two landing gear piece together which is missing  I checked the image of product here and I can see that these spacer are there in the last image (the image of and screws ). I am very disappointed since its difficult to find the exact spacer locally in stores\\nThis is the worst model ever sssssoooooo small\\nBroke immediately. Too noisy\\n\"I bought this because it looked like it would be a good pistol, it\\'s not. It\\'s cheaply made and it shoots inaccurately. You need two hands to shoot it because you have to pull back the hammer with one hand and shoot with the other. Spend 5 dollars more and get the Nerf Zombie Strike Hammershot Blaster instead. It shoots the same darts faster and more accurately than this pistol and it only takes one hand to fire so you can duel wield it! Take it from a guy who\\'s a pro in cubicle warfare, this is not the gun you are looking for.\"\\nIt deflated within an hour\\n\"It sure was fun to play when it arrived. Well, the fun did not last long. After about two weeks the vehicle stopped going straight. Turns out that the motor controlling the left wheels went bad.\"\\nSo cheap. So awful. After fifteen minutes the car will not stay on the track. I can hardly believe this company is in business. My son is so bummed.\\nDidn\\'t work\\nCame half dried out and totally bummed. Still don\\'t have a set of ink pads that work properly. What a PAIN\\nThe truck is quite small and the tires come off the rims very easily. Probably ok for an adult not a good option for a child.\\n\"I ordered this product because I asked for bulk bubbles and the pic even showed bulk bubbles but I swear it said I was getting a 5 cases of bubbles which is what I needed, not 5 small bottles of bubbles which is what I got. I should have known because it was such a great deal but Amazon is known for great deals, if I had known these were being sold 1 bottle at a time not 1 case at a time I would not have bought them. Instead of a great deal I got totally screwed and now I still have to go into town and get more bubbles for the party anyway. Make it more clear or don\\'t sell them individually. Below is a true pic of what you get, I ordered 5 cases and only received 5 individual bottles.\"\\n\"This is by far the worst rc motorcycle iv\\'e ever owned. Don\\'t buy it. Not worth $20. Didn\\'t respond to the controller the 2nd day of use. Would recommend the &#34;Top Race 4 Channel RC Remote Control Motorcycle Goes on 2 Wheels with Built in Gyroscope, 1:10 Scale&#34;\"\\nRead the fine print carefully.  This arrived in a small box because the frame was not included.  Now I have to go frame this.  Look for one\\'s with the frame included.  It will save you time and more money.\\n\"Was not the game we remembered as kids. Too many changes and they didn\\'t even include enough parts to play properly. Would have returned it, but since we opened it, they wouldn\\'t take it back.\"\\n\"Directions are worded odd. If you follow them, you end up with an unusable blob of stuff and mad children.\"\\n\"Worked for about a month.  Then one of them stopped working.  My husband tried fixing it, but no luck.\"\\n\"Very cheap looking.  Will not buy again, ever.\"\\nWas disappointed by the size and quality of this item I last purchase.....\\n\"The doll was exactly the one I wanted, but the hair on the back was faded pink because it was in the package too long.\"\\nThe ball was defective. Ball kept deflating no matter how man times we blew it us. Wish I knew that was gonna happened.  I would have returned it but oh well.\\nvery strong awefull chemical smell!!! couldn\\'t get rid of it even after washing and air drying. All of it went to the trash. Would not recommend it.\\nJunk. Cheaply constructed. All plastic.\\nLeaked immediately from the brass fitting. Worthless.\\nMy parents bought this at Walmart and it was only able to entertain my 2 1/2yo son for 2 minutes.  It doesn\\'t wiggle and most of the sprayers pointed into the grass.  We ended up just bringing out the sprinkler.  Complete waste of money.\\nThe product is very light plastic and will not last in my classroom very long. Stick with Melissa and Doug.\\nDoesn\\'t look anything like the picture shows and after playing with it once it broke...\\n\"Don\\'t waste your money (especially at this price!), this ball does NOT glow like depicted in the picture.\"\\nGot one and ir was the WORST quality i\\'ve ever seen. I wouldn\\'t recommend buying from Funko again..\\nThis was very disappointing as the entire set is primarily dollhouse scale and far too small to look accurate with the traditional size models.\\n\"Disappointed,  cheap quality.\"\\nwanted to get a safer alternative to the metal pins for a 2 year old.but the quality was so poor it didn\\'t even survive the shipping journey!\\nDoesn\\'t have the original piece that clips the battery to the charger and the Big Jake vehiclr\\nThey don\\'t self seal. Once they fall off the fill thing the water squirts right out and many of them had holes. Waste of money.\\n\"I just received my order. When I took them out to wash them ( before letting my four year old twin grand children play with them,) I realized that the red bowl was not included. And the dishes have a bad odor. So now, I am not sure how to proceed.\"\\n\"This toy is very poorly designed. The directions provided leave out important details, and the number of steps the child has to take to load it is ridiculous. the trigger mechanism and crossbow fall apart after each action.I purchased it for my granddaughter who became frustrated after 5 loads.<br />Don\\'t waste your money!\"\\n\"So cheap, the back of the couch won\\'t even stay up. Don\\'t waste your money\"\\ncheap...\\nMine didn\\'t come in mosaic rare. :/<br />I\\'m bummed yo\\n\"Bounces on water ? ? ? Really ?  What a rip off , this bonces on water like any other ball , hits one time and floats ?  I don\\'t get whats so special about it besides the outrageous price !  You can buy any 99 cent ball at wally world and it will do the same .\"\\ni have seen the original figure the box says no recast allowed. This product is a port painted resin recast!\\n\"Not what we expected .. The pictures depict there would be several minifigures and there was only one .. And the price was outrageous when the same pack at toys r us are 3.00, so my son and I was greatly disappointed to see this big box that felt empty . The pics are very misleading along. With me not wanting to order from off line due to circumstances as such , but my 8 year old would not let up and now he see why I don\\'t like to order anything off line\"\\n\"Very disappointed in this product. The ballons, once filled, were small. And they quickly lost all their water. We couldn\\'t use them.\"\\n\"Received product broken. Replaced batteries, dolls &#34; do not sing&#34;\"\\n\"Don\\'t waste money on this for a non-swimmer, it doesn\\'t offer enough bouncy to keep them safely and comfortably afloat, buy the actual PFD verson. I had read reviews that said likewise, but didn\\'t heed the warning, ended up puchasing a puddlejumper with much more success and happiness from my child\"\\nThe instructions are microscopic. It falls apart every 10 seconds. The arms and legs aren\\'t articulated or posable. Whoever designed this pile of cheap plasticized excrement obviously does not have children.<br /><br />Only buy this if you are prepared to lose hours of your life putting it back together while your child cries in despair.  Just glue it together in battle mode and be done with it.\\nI was mislead on quality of product I was expecting an actual hard plastic case not a fold open paper thin plastic container\\nThey do not sit upright in water. :/\\nBought two.  Each broke before two weeks old.\\n\"If you want to make your kids cry this is the toy for you. It will pop within 20 minutes of playing with it.  When it pops and your kids are crying remember I told you not to buy this absolute waste of time and money,\"\\nBroke immediately\\nTerribly crafted.  Valves pop open/don\\'t stay closed.  Straps very uncomfortable.  Would have returned if I had saved the box!\\ntoo cheap\\nWill not go down the stairs. My 2 boys asked me what it\\'s supposed to do. I guess I\\'ll have to get the classic metal one to show them. It was broken in pieces within a day.\\nThis is not the original black and red connect four :(\\nDon\\'t waste your money! Bought this item for a tubing trip. Didn\\'t last even an hour until it got a hole and completely blew and filled with water. Patches were worthless and didn\\'t even stay on. Also bought the single person tubes from the same company and they were amazing. I do not recommend the two seater. If it pops that\\'s 2 people thay no longer have a tube to float in. Go with the single person.\\nExtremely poor quality.\\nPoorly made\\nWe received this as a gift for my 3 yr old. It was amazing once we charged batteries for it and got it doing its thing. Less than 10 minutes later it his a baseboard and a wheel popped off.<br />Before it broke it was awesome fun for all of the kids to watch and dance to the music it plays.\\nI had no idea it was just flat! So disappointed!\\nThe whole tree would fall down when you try to hang the monkeys on it. This went in the trash after amazon wouldn\\'t take it back.\\n\"Ship is too weak to truly use, no really useful cars. Only get to complete your faction set.\"\\nI purchased this less than 2 weeks ago and it is already crap. Bent with minimal use and only a few toys inside. Mom of five gives this a thumbs down!\\nDidn\\'t work\\nIt sucks\\n\"They are really cute, but out of 12 i think half stayed inflated, i\\'m very disappointed! :(\"\\nLenses cracked.

I can\\'t believe so many people actually like it...... If he actually looked like Goku (obviously with the bigger SS3 neanderthal-like facial features) this would look great but he reminds me more of Joker or something w/o makeup..... I had to go look up video reviews cause the pic on here sucks so much and when I saw his face I burst out laughing it\\'s that bad.... What\\'s wrong with all of you? Am I the only DBZ fan who actually knows what Goku looks like? Maybe it\\'s cause I just watched the entire series again this past week idk....

It was impossible to move it to re-align it. I had to cut the fabric in order to access the nozzle. Terrible quality control. With so many competing options, why buy this?\"\\n\"This was a birthday gift for a 9 year old boy.  He was excited to receive it.  The next day I asked if he had built it.  He said one of the first pieces broke, so the ship could not be built.  Basically I wasted my money on this gift.  Very disappointed!!\"\\n\"Essentially a package of nuts and bolts arrived in an unmarked box. One would expect the product to arrive in the manufacturer\\'s packaging, but no. Upon assembly I discovered that two pieces were missing. A very unprofessional move.\"\\n\"watched the video that is in the pictures of this item and it clearly showed a girl pulling a string to release the mentos into the coke bottle. The one I received has no string and looks a LOT shorter than the one used in the video as well. Mine has a small trap that I have to pull out and then get out of the way. I tried tying a string to the trap but if I pulled too hard the coke bottle fell over...<br />This is a great experiment, just know the item used in the video and the one you receive are two DIFFERENT items.\"\\nI wouldn\\'t even give it one star it broke as soon as I was about to use it.  The dual turned too much and would not turn anymore.\\nMy daughter was definitely not interested?\\nDid not like this at all!! When we were filling the balloons up almost all of them popped off about 5 were usable and the size of a golf ball!!

Rubber bands are not tight enough so balloons don\\'t hold the water. Kids were very excited when they arrived but out of 111 balloons, less than 10 held enough water to be usable. We bought 2 packages but didn\\'t even bother opening the 2nd package and will be requesting a refund.<br /><br />There is another brand we saw that worked much better, don\\'t remember the name - Out of 35 balloons, only a couple did not fill which is much more acceptable.\"\\nThese dolls are too big to be Barbie babies. That is what we purchased them for and had to return them.\\nFell apart before I got it out of the box!\\nReturning this product. Tried it in every room of the house and the app wouldnt work properly.  Really disappointed\\ni bought it on my baby\\'s birthday ..don\\'t wanna gave even one star ..it looks cool on photo but in reality don\\'t have power ..don\\'t have speed ..hardly runs..and when I asked to return they said we can\\'t take it back..make sure read return policy ...\\nno can get wrong # on it\\nI ordered the polyurethane wheels but received the hard plastic wheels. I finally found the replacement wheels and switched them out. My kids love the car but I wasn\\'t impressed with the service.\\n\"When it came, the batteries didnt work and i had to buy new ones for it.

Believe the ratings and reviews (like I should have!)<br />1.I only recieved 18 (6 new packs containing 3 each)<br />2.They were NOT all &#34;SQUINKIES FOR GIRLS&#34; I received 9 BOYS and 9 GIRLS. Aliens and footballer players with angry faces are not Fairies.<br />3.They come new in packaging with bubbles with lame backpack dangles. I didn\\'t want or order bubbles or dangles. According to the description they do not come with these.<br />4.In the lot we received we have 3 pigs. In the description it says &#34;most lots have NO duplicates&#34;. I guess I just got lucky?

Nothing came out and i\\'m very dissapointed.\\n\"This product was different in the picture as to the product that was actually recieved! I was unable to use the product for the babyshower, not happy at all\"\\nVery disappointed. Cheaply made. The handle bar decorations broke the very first day and the screw on the license plate is rusty causing it to fall. Would not recommend.\\n\"Way too small!  I can\\'t believe how tiny this was, especially compared to the &#34;boy&#34; super soaker I ordered at the same time that was the same price.  Gender inequality strikes again.  Major fail!\"\\nBroke first time my son flew it do not get it.\\n\"Same problem as earlier negative reviewers, except I disregarded their reviews and purchased the mat in 2015.  If you haven\\'t ordered this yet, please read this first.  The smell is sickening and doesn\\'t dissipate like they say on their website.  It is much stronger and incomparable to typical new plastic product smell.  (Background info: I\\'m the kind of mom who buys Naturepedic mattress, Naturepedic changing pad, and organic products whenever I can for my baby)<br /><br />I bought the mat newly ordered from Korea at a local store.  5 months later, the smell is still going strong.  I waited for the smell to go away like Dwinguler suggested and now it\\'s too late to return to mat.  Since mine was newly made from Dwinguler, I wonder if the no-smell-mats from some reviews are due to very old stock (where the mat already emitted their toxic gas elsewhere)??  The smell also sticks to our clothes and hair like cigarette stinks.  I only let my baby on it with a play mat on top, but he would still smell of the plastic without even touching it.  I\\'m not so sure if I should trust them that this sickening smell is safe.  My baby will be crawling soon and I\\'m quite concerned.<br /><br />If you are buying the mat anyways, please please return it if it smells because it doesn\\'t go away like they say!  Don\\'t wait until the return period expires!  Even if the mat is really non-toxic, the smell really makes me sick.  I\\'m now hiding at the furthest room from the mat with the baby while writing this review..feeling nauseas :(\"\\nJust bad.\\n\"Super disappointed. Did not realize that my drinking glass is bigger than this item.so whatever i paid plus shipping, i shouldve just thrown my money out of my window while driving\"\\n\"small,wavy screen\"\\nDon\\'t Buy Run Like A Dog Is After You Pure Junk !!!! PS Don\\'t Never Buy 27.145 MHz Never I Mean NEVER .\\n\"I agree with most of the reviews here - the photograph is extremely misleading wrt size - it\\'s 2 toddlers at most. And having to run the hose non-stop is just kind of offensive.  But I had much worse problems:<br /><br />None of the inflatable starfish stacking rings will inflate. We have tried multiple pumps and multiple people.  We have kept the air pump attached for upwards of 5 minutes with no air at all getting into the rings.  All the other pieces inflated fine with the same pump and procedure, but the rings are pretty much a total loss, which has made my toddler cry twice.<br /><br />The plastic that this thing is made of sticks together - the bed of the pool will create folds that are so tightly stuck together that I feel like I\\'m going to tear and stretch it when trying to separate them.,<br /><br />Additionally, the design of the slide is ridiculous. I realize it\\'s important to have the water base for weight and stability - but it\\'s nearly impossible to put water into it before it\\'s inflated, because - as I mentioned - the plastic really sticks together extremely tightly, so there\\'s no place for the water to go. The water goes into what spaces there are, but there\\'s no way to attach a hose so that air can\\'t escape - the directions say to &#34;gently pour&#34; the water into the slide.  Good grief, Banzai, learn some physics - poured water is not strong enough to separate out adhered plastic; as soon as the the gaps are filled in the water just overflows.  BUT, of course - physics again! - if you try to inflate it first so that the plastic isn\\'t as crumpled, the air pressure from the sides pushes the water out too.  We\\'ve got it inflated with just air and we have to hold it steady for him to use it. RIDICULOUS.<br /><br />My child was very excited about it - I have no idea how professional designers could come up with such a stupid plan but it\\'s a real shame.  I\\'ll never buy anything from this company again, which is unfortunate because in theory the products look nice.  UGH.\"\\n\"The boat looks great, however ours did not work. One propeller did not turn, and upon inserting the batteries, the one that did work would turn on automatically.  Please beware!!\"\\n\"First review ever in Amazon. My in-laws got my daughter this for her birthday. I have to say that I was pleased that they were buying something made in the US. However, when I saw what it was inside I though it was a joke..&#34;The Chinese hacked the box and put something cheap inside&#34; I though.! Too many parts, requires screws, takes about 1.5 - 2 hours to put together. You will feel like your back in the 80\\'s when you start puting this thing together. I\\'m not sure how this company is stilll in businees selling this type of product.\"\\n\"The back had writing on it, making it un-useable.\"\\nNever got to enjoy.

These are not like the advertised photo. The eggs are the same, but we got one green and 35 blue dinosaurs, 32 of which were identical. VERY disappointed 6 year old opened them saying... &#34;another blue long neck&#34;.\"\\nThe first order I only received one. The second order there were two.  These are not for little kids. They are very large bags and very expensive.\\nCheap Chinese knockoffs\\n\"The food is tiny and most of it does NOT look &#34;real.&#34;  I returned this set and bought a different multi-set from ToysRUs, which I loved.

My favorite board game mixed with my favorite literary character, what could go wrong? Well first of all, there is no board. It literally is a pack of 100 cards and a die.  So good luck playing an actual game. So disappointed. Can\\'t believe I got charged 20$ for questions I could have made up myself and no board!\"\\nNot what I pre-ordered...<br />When I pre-ordered this item it had the Vault Boy for the picture... not the Ghoul and the listing said Vault Boy like it does as I\\'m writing this description. When the picture changed to the Ghoul I thought nothing of it. Very dissapointed that I recieved the Ghoul and if I still want the Vault Boy I\\'ll have to pay more than double to get it. Highly dissatisfied.\\nThe skirt is not as full as in the picture. The headband is thinner.  The bra straps r too short.

Way to go latrax way to go.\\nA lot of the necklaces only half of the necklace glowed.  I had a lot of really disappointed kids!\\nOne came damage\\nDo not waste your money this is over priced. You can purchase it at the Disney Store right now for $15 when not on sale it is usually $20-$25.\\n\"I actually purchased this from Target because I was in a time crunch (and its $12 cheaper there). Opened the box and started to assemble only to find MISSING MANY PARTS!!! Including a wheel, the steering column and more. And the parts we did assemble before realizing we were short, were very difficult to get together. You will also need tools to assemble, fyi, for any other moms trying to do this on the fly. There was definitely lots of cursing and frustration as I tried to assemble it before my daughters birthday party- was actually relieved parts were missing and I could quit, but sad for her to not recieve a gift from us.<br /><br />I don\\'t know what\\'s up with Radio Flyer, but if you purchase this, buy in plenty of time to check for all the parts, get super frustrated trying to assemble it, and return it and try again if necessary.\"\\n\"The toy is imaginative and fun BUT within minutes a screw holding up the ladder part fell off! We have tightened it several times now but as our grandson runs around with it, it un-tightens and falls out. This is a safety concern and just bad construction. We will have to figure out a way to glue over the screws!\"\\nShoddy paint job. Model is missing paint in spots all over as well as excessive paint smears on the back of the model.\\nThis is in pieces and not a complete figure as advertised. I am very disappointed that I waited a month for this item to get mailed for Japan and it a bunch of little pieces and not assembled as an action figure. Plus the instructions to put it together are in Japanese! NOT a great item for Star Wars Black Series fans. Don\\'t be fooled. Don\\'t buy from Japan.\\nCorrect me if I\\'m wrong but...shouldn\\'t these cva dogbones be the same length? The package I received had different lengths...FAIL.\\nThe batteries never worked even when I put new ones in.\\n\"Seat was ripped, too much of a hassle to send back. Not worth the money\"\\nIf you\\'re looking for ducks that will float these are not it. They all turned upside down. Bought as a baby shower decoration to float in the punch bowl and they just wouldn\\'t stay up right regardless of what we tried. Total junk :(\\nTerrible quality.\\nVery disappointed! Have ordered these before and was happy but my last order amazon got them from a different supplier and are fake!!! Have to admit they did a excellent job but when you compare them side by side to other REAL shopkins its becomes easy to spot the difference! Also on two shopkins the paint job on the details where awful!!!! Mistakes can happen with shopkins but with these two it was really bad!!! Color and eyes are tiny bit off as well!! My daughter is heart broken! Very expensive for fake shopkins and heart breaking!!\\nvery fragile and operation is not the best.\\nGOT HOLE IN IT FIRST DAY WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN\\nHorrible product and customer service is nonexistence. The circuit board\\'s quality is really bad.  The solder joints are all eroded and looks like it was salvaged from a damaged unit.  Don\\'t bother buying from this seller.\\nvery to small\\n\"Not exactly what i ordered. I ordered a stuffed animal, but i received a low quality similar product.\"\\npoor quality product\\nIt sucks It is no stars but i had to put something\\n\"I order from Amazon all the time and this is my first review.  Do not waste your money on this product. When I received it, there was no assembly instructions, no tool, the screws do not even fit and the plastic was already torn. I wouldn\\'t pay $10 for this. I put it together in 10 min just to humor myself and thought I just might let my 10 month old get on it.  Think again! It is completely unstable and the first time my 2 year old pushes it over, you can bet one of them will hit their head on the big bolts that stick out. Completely dissatisfied and will be returning.\"\\nNo cups at all very disappointed. I ordered two sets of these and neither had the hello kitty cups. Not worth it\\nMuscles structure are jot really deluxe as those are not fill with sponge and loose shape when touched\\n\"I purchased 2 of these at Target for my kids. They didn\\'t blow bubbles at all, they just leaked bubble solution all over the kids. I returned them.\"\\n\"The pieces were so small, my little 5 year old could barely put them together.\"\\nNOT AUTHENTIC!!! I purchased 2 12 packs of Shopkins. My son was so excited and opened the packages only to realize that both packages contained fake Shopkins! Buyer Beware!!\\nTerrrrrrrible. This thing sheds worse than I do at 7 months post partum. Hoping to return it.\\n\"Horribly pitted, not stainless. They rusted from cleaning quite badly. I know it\\'s just an anatomy set, but we at least need the two sides of our instruments to be level with each other and the same length. Hard to pick up anything small with any of the instruments.\"\\n\"It\\'s not what they use to be when they first came out. There really small. Hard to play around with. Kind of disappointed really. And you don\\'t get to choose what color, its randomly picked.\"\\nBroke after one month of very little play. I can\\'t return it because it has been over 30 days.\\n\"My 5 year old daughter got this for her birthday.  She took it out of the gift bag and the top came off when she set it down.  Can\\'t get it to go back on, can\\'t fix it, can\\'t return it because we can\\'t find a store that sells it.  It\\'s a piece of junk.\"\\nDidn\\'t work. Waste of money...sent it back.\\n\"I bought this with the expectation that there would be duplication of some cards. I never would have guessed that I would get 20 copies of not one but two of the cards, and not useful ones, so 40 of the cards are just trash pretty much.\"\\n\"I would not purchase from Tales of Adventure. My playset of unbreathing horde was in one sleeve with the heavy duty case, but on the OUTSIDE with tape on all sides. If your going to send me my cheap cards this way how do you treat other cards?!\"\\n\"It came to me corroded and damaged. From what I can tell it\\'s made from the cheapest of metals and that being said, is easy to bend out of shape. Needless to say not what I was looking for or expected in a magic prop.\"\\nPiece of junk. Has to be completely assembled. Do not buy\\nDeceiving sales. Brilliant though. It\\'s  not like 3 would make it a more valuable purchase.  #stupidamericans\\n\"I have now ordered 2 of these launch sets.  Everything was easy to assemble but the the launch did not launch (kind of an important factor).  I am an experienced rocket builder/launcher so I know it is not user error.  Unfortunately I didn\\'t try utilizing the replacement launcher right away so I did not notice the issue until the return period expired.  Now i am stuck with a launch pad that doesn\\'t launch!<br /><br />Poor quality, don\\'t waste you\\'r money!\"\\n\"Don\\'t waste your money- pieces don\\'t fit back together well.  If you want a display, they would work - just not usable.\"\\nthere wasn\\'t a confederate flag on the general lee I received ...I returned it....the picture shows a flag and the REAL general lee has one...My sons love the dukes of hazard show and I was very disappointed in this car did not have the flag.\\nbroke within a day!  returned it....\\nThis thing took ages to arrive and broke right out of the package.

I may return it.\"\\ndoes not work looks like melted craon\\n\"I ordered these yesterday and I was pretty psyched for them..until they arrive ,instead of the box of 6 they advertised I was given a SINGLE figure.JUST ONE. So please spare yourself the headache and DO NOT BUY THESE\"\\n\"Did not work, was a waste of money. Was supposed to be a funny prank but nothing happened\"\\n\"Not worth the price,and came apart fast. Have some old ones years old and still going strong\"\\n\"I just received this and it took quite a while to inflate (you inflate 1-2 sections at a time).  Once completed, the ball started to deflate quite rapidly.  In some cases, the plugs would not even stay in the inflation holes.\"\\n\"I wont ever purchase again because they did not glow in the dark,they were regular belly rings. I give it a 0 very very poor. False advertisement is not good for business. Dnt ever purchase glow belly rings online.\"\\nThe idea was wonderful. The balls do not stay hidden after the hippos catch them and it\\'s just a hassle to play because of the design.\\nThis is most upsetting my package went to a different a dress  especially when I spoke to a representative and made my address clear.she also guaranteed that a notation was put on my account explaining  the details  .now I am without my item.please notify ups of their incompetence\\n\"Bad quality, doesn\\'t really fit the cards well (I used it on resistance)\"\\n\"I purchased this Castle for my Granddaughter on her second birthday, she played with it for  approx. 2 hours, and the<br />button that operates the audio snapped off the castle (terrible design).  I called Amazon for the contact info for the manufacturer, and was given  the phone # for Disney Consumer Products.  I called Disney, and was told on no uncertain terms &#34;being that I did not purchase the Castle from Disney.com, they could not, and would not help me with an exchange&#34;.<br />I was told to contact Amazon for help.  I emailed Amazon my findings, and being the top notch company they are, credited my account and processed the return. Disney needs to stand behind their products, no matter where they are purchased, be more consumer friendly, and do a better job on approving designs for the toys they license. This castle has a poor design, and is cheaply made,..... caveat emptor.\"\\n\"this is the worst paint I have ever tried to work with. Generally their paint is fine, but something went wrong with this kit. I purchased this a few months back and have just now tried to use it. the first bottle I opened gave me a few drops of paint then the tip clogged, i opened up the bottle to find a large chunk of congealed paint stuck to the spout, another was nothing but pigment too dry to reconstitute.Every bottle had some kind of problem, perhaps the paint was old or the bottles defective . In any account it\\'s a wast of money.\"\\nDidn\\'t even get one day of play out of it. Pumped it up the night before and it was sagging and droopy in the morning. Tried pumping it again - same result. Obviously it came with a hole somewhere. Returned to Amazon.\\nThis ball is awful! Save your money! All both of my kids will do with this is shake it and it makes a very loud noise\\n\"Very cheap, came apart right away...ended up trashing it.\"\\nVery bad\\nIt took over two-weeks to arrive. It had a smal pin-size leak in the arm seam and lost inflation every couple of hours.\\n\"We bought this toy at the Seattle Aquarium, and thought it would be fun and cute. While it\\'s cute, we realized that even taking it out of the water and drying it off would not stop it from moving - and it makes a clicking noise while running. The blasted thing kept going and going all night long, keeping us awake. The only way to make it stop is to take it apart to take the batteries out (using a watch or jeweler\\'s screwdriver). This greatly overrides and fun the thing gives you during the day.\"\\nWe got this for our 2yrs old birthday and the fabric portion of the toy as already frayed in three different spots.  The stitching is done SO terribly and is just FALLING apart.  The seat wont even stay attached to the frame.  While this is VERY CUTE.  the quality of the actual stroller is fine and went together very well...but fabric is a HUNK OF JUNK.  The entire toy is WORTHLESS.\\nTrue plasticine clay does not float or dissolve in water. This clay does. I should have known when it arrived in a box labeled &#34;magic clay.&#34;\\nBlew the parrot up and within minutes it was flat... So basically I wasted my money\\nAttempted to fill the balloons but over 3/4 of them leaked all there water out within 5mins or less. Definitely would not buy or recommend anyone else to buy either.\\nIt is NOT worthy at all.  DO NOT buy it!!! DO NOT be fooled.\\nVery small. Made for toddler. Picture looks bigger. Very disappointed.\\nThese are terrible I got them at the store because it said it grows instantly but when I got home I put them in water after reading the directions and expected them to grow immediately. I waited for a few minutes and they didn\\'t grow at all and then I read the back of the package and it said just to put it in water buy I did some research online and it takes almost 2 days for them to grow to their full size. I am very very disappointed in this product\\n\"I put this on my Amazon wish list and a friend bought it for my twins. Keys are terribly out of tune, and while this g is<br />Much aller than the picture shows, and the keys very small  for little ones to strike one at a time.  If you want to get your little one their first instrwument, don\\'t bother with this!  For $27 it should be easy to play and close to being in tune.\"\\nThe accessories are really difficult to put on and remove!\\nNot satisfied\\n\"Terrible quality, half of the caps are missing powder and most of them don\\'t shoot off. Needless to say my six year old was not a happy camper.\"\\nPiece o crap\\n\"I\\'m very disappointed at the quality of this toy, it\\'s all plastic, not the nice sturdy kind, the cheap kind. At least they could have made the joints have some metal where they\\'re pivoting. First the backhoe stopped working at the joint 3 weeks after purchase, now the front loader completely broke off, so now we only have a yellow tractor with nothing to play in the dirt with.\"\\nCaught on fire.  Very dangerous\\n\"The jacks and balls were smaller than they look in the picture, and smaller than the ones in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s, all can fit into a 2&#34;x 2&#34; pouch. The balls didn\\'t have enough bounce, kind of a thud. Very disappointed when I finally got to the tiny little pouch inside a cheap box that could have held at least 10 pouches. I basically bought a little box.I did find a good set of ball and jacks like the ones made in the 50/ 60\\'s era, made by Schylling of Rowley,Ma., but made in China for $4.99. Only one ball, but it bounces. . . .\"\\nBoat never worked even bought new battery still never work has to return and buy from someone else because seller wouldn\\'t replace it\\nNOT ACCURATE DESCRIPTION. SELLER IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. TRYING TO RETURN ITEM SINCE WEIGHT LIMIT IS MISLEADING.\\n\"When it arrived at my house, the bow was snapped in half. Not worth the wait or the money.\"\\n\"The wooden Schwinn sign along each side now comes already fixed to the wagon. When we took the wagon out of the box we could see the manufacturer had drilled the sign on too tightly and its cracked the sign almost in two. The split was razor sharp and dangerous, we had to take the sign off. It also arrived with paint chipped off the metal body. This new wagon which cost us AUD$400 with shipping out of the box looks like a second hand piece of junk. (it was double box packed and the box shows no signs of damage)<br />Also the spacers are too narrow for the rear wheels, there is massive play and so when you pull the wagon it rattles horribly.<br />I would strongly recommend people Not Buy this or dont have high expectations. The quality control for this company on this product is appalling. I do feel ripped off on this purchase. I am ashamed for the person who actually screwed the sign on, cracked it and then put it in the box for a child to receive and in our case as a birthday gift.<br />Now we are trying to track down the manufacturers contact details hoping to get a replacement.<br />Will post update on how that goes.\"\\n\"Horrible. The cups all had pieces torn, like they were torn in production by the machinery. Could not use. There were 2 stickers in the package, an attempt to justify calling it &#34;miner&#34; party. Colors were far from Minecraft theme. Very disappointed.\"\\n\"After weeks of care, we see that we have successfully grown three leaf clovers. Not a single four leaf in the batch. Thanks for nothing.\"\\n\"I have a one year old Main-coon cat, as you know they love to play in water.  I purchased the dazzling wind-up fish for entertainment for him,  he was more afraid of it.  The fish swims more on its side, it swims for a very very short period.  I purchased a helium balloon at the Dollar store and tied a feather at the end of the ribbon which he has more fun with the balloon then the fish. Sorry Mr. Fish.\"\\nThe zipper ripped out on first use.\\n\"Bought this for my little brother who is obsessed with peacocks. The shipping was faster than expected, however when I opened the package I was very disappointed. The peacock image on the backpack is not nearly as bright has it is in the picture, and the backpack itself is extremely small. Ended up returning it.\"\\n\"I was very excited to give my nephew Woody for his birthday (with all of the Toy Story toys made by Disney). What a waste of money. The string came undone  from the plastic loop shortly after opening, and went right inside the voice box. We tried to fix it but can\\'t get it to stay. You would think whoever came up with the design would have te string tied much more tightly and/or something around it to prevent the string from going inside. Unfortunately, spacing out when you buy presents doesn\\'t work well for return windows. Hopefully I can find someone who can repair him for a decent price, because I\\'m surely not wasting my money on another one.\"\\n\"Leg holes are very big. It says 3 and up but the other reviews said they used it for their infants. Granted my 9 month old is only 17 lbs, but i didnt feel safe leaving her alone in this for more time than it took me to climb into our pool. The outer rings deflate occasionally (as with all plastic floats), but the more we inflated the rings the bigger the animals head got. After a few weeks it was bigger than a beach ball and blocked her view. we threw it away and got a simple $20 nylon one at walmart and she LOVES it.\"\\n\"This is badly mis-labeled - this is a game for 6-8 yr olds - for anyone older, it\\'s a stupid game, it was a huge disappointment.\"\\n\"For this price, I can\\'t believe how small it is!  No way a 1 year old can pull this and it will not fall over.  The people pieces are small.  It\\'s going back.\"\\n😕\\n\"Very disappointing, these are very small. And you get much better looking ones with the cup cake paper cups as a set at most dollar stores.

It was a gift for my grandsons birthday what a disappointment after charging the battery as the directions said plugged it into the boat and nothing no power.  Put it in water to see if it would turn on of course not.  The directions when you read them are very pour they were not written by anybody that knows how to speak English, and the translation from Chinese to English was a joke when you read it.\"\\nNot a very good model. Need to bend plastic track pieces and they break. Model does not fit together very well. Note worth the price.\\n\"I received the wrong product. It was supposed to be princess but I received tinkerbell, instead.

Very frustrating!\\n\"This bag is extremely small, there is not enough confetti to fill one hand.\"\\n\"Bought these for my sons birthday party as they were supposed to glow . . . , I found that while they do grow in size, they DO NOT GLOW as advertised. Big bummer and waste of money.\"\\nDidn\\'t like this\\nPlease note this is NOT the Ender Dragon even though it came up in the search as such. Definitely a doctored plush item.\\nGot the ball for my daughter who was three months old at the time. Not only is this thing heavy but it didn\\'t do as much as I thought it did. Now it\\'s broken and sounds like a skipping CD. Forgot to mention how annoying this toy is in the first place but now it plays the same few notes over and over again. If you can imagine a three year old isn\\'t going to be rough with it. Very disappointed with this product.\\nEnjoyed putting beads into pattern but never could get beads to stay together once they were sprayed with water\\nThe headphones I received did not work. Very disappointed.\\nThe tongs arrived with the red rubber cover on one side split.

Really sorry I made this purchase.\\nAs soon as i got it looked nothing like the picture then it just fell apart\\nI ordered these napkins for a 50th anniversary party expecting them to be  gold like the picture. The color is more like a dark mustard olive green. They are not the metallic gold like they say. If you are wanting gold napkins do not order these.

None of the batteries will charge.\\nIt is way too hard to blow air through the pens for a adult and for the kids it\\'s impossible. I felt like I was going to pass out  trying to get a picture done.

Not sure what half of the people saying it does is talking about... its crap, don\\'t waste your money.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased this for my son.... who thinks farting is hysterical... He did not even get to see it... It doesn\\'t sound like a far, but more of a noise maker you use at New Years....  I have those already.. I wanted something I could use in the car when he got restless in his car seat... this is worthless... If you do nothing else, make sure to read reviews on this before you purchase.\"\\nFAKE! These are not real Legos and made of poor material and craftsman ship. I\\'d rather pay more and get real Legos that will last 30 years rather then this JUNK!!!\\n\"Just got the item. I was were very excited to have my son use it, but the unit is missing the phone handle and does not turn on. VERY VERY disappointed!\"\\n\"Look very deceiving, not worth the money.\"\\n\"The plastic cover or top part of the piano is easily taken off by the baby. Thought the cover was attached to the piano. With the cover off, the baby has access to the little parts.\"\\nI  HATE IT YOU CANT EVEN WASH THEM\\n\"I didn\\'t buy this set, but they are available separately and I did buy one. Here\\'s my review of it:<br />...<br /><br />This is a shoddy no-name toy of the type sold in dollar stores. It\\'s worth maybe $2 or $3 at most; it even comes in a plastic bag labeled &#34;TOYS&#34;.<br /><br />It\\'s made of regular plastic, not fiberglass. It comes with garish stickers already applied; the wings and tail need to be snapped on. It\\'s got lumpy chromed wheels, the two halves of the body don\\'t fit together perfectly, the wings are loose in their sockets and droop, and one had an engine already broken off.<br /><br />It looks like the rest of it would break or fall apart the first time a kid played with it - and that\\'s all it\\'s good for; it\\'s certainly not a model/replica that you would want to preserve or proudly display.<br /><br />The only good things I can say are that the proportions look like a real airliner (except for the friction motor and wheels) and it has molded-in details that add some realism, like the windows, doors, wing flaps, etc.<br /><br />P.S. You can see most of the problems mentioned above if you zoom the product photos and look carefully.\"\\ndo not grow\\n\"The mat is big and soft. I really wish I can love it and let my 8 month old baby play on it. However, the mat has a super strong chemical smell and makes me feel very concerned about its safety.\"\\n\"Random?  So you want Heisenberg but get Marie?  Gee, I wonder why no one\\'s buying this stupid idea.\"\\nI bought one of these on Prime Now and the blades turned once and the unit quit working completely.  I called customer service and they promptly sent a return able along with my refund.  I figured this was a one off and ordered a second one and it promptly quit working after the first flight.  The whole right side of the copter quit rotating.  I am very disappointed in this product and it is very obvious that it has quality issues.  If i could post a review with negative stars if I could.\\nSquished when received\\nBroke after two days. Not worth it.\\n\"These balloons pop extremely easily. After getting a dozen filled with helium, half of them popped before making it back to the house.\"\\n\"Bought this because it looked so awesome and was cheaper than legos - I screamed and cried more than once putting it together. The instructions were difficult to follow (as an adult) and the pieces are not well fitted so my hands hurt and I had to take several breaks before I got it together. The structure is not very stable; there is alot of air inside when you complete it. Wish I had bought the lego set instead. After it fell apart, we threw out everything but the music box and horses.\"\\nWhen you allow children to be able with out parent code to order an clean out your checking acct like my great grandson did I am very unhappy.no way to store 5 orders of leg go\\'s that I\\'ll send back once they come but still that\\'s almost 3 weeks with no money.\\nCheap\\n\"The stix seem to be too rough, thick and heavy to really move without moving the others.

Avoid! What a Rip Off!\\n\"I ordered two packages of 12&#34; (when INFLATED) beach balls (18 total in each package) as described and pictured in Amazon photos. The beach balls I received looked like the ones pictured and there were 18 items in each of the two packages I ordered.  However, the beach balls were 7&#34; INFLATED NOT 12&#34; INFLATED as stated in Amazon description.  Of the 36 beach balls I received, 5 were defective. I returned for a refund.\"\\nNone of devices listed on the Anki web site would work. I purchased this for my 8 year old grandson who does not have a smart phone ( go figure)  I was thinking the samsung or Asus tablets would work but they did not.  The staff at Anki was very helpfull but could only tell me the tablets I have are under review. I also tried to download the program on my wifes new smart phone which I could not. To bad because this set looks so cool in the video. Returned the item\\n\"Disappointed with the product.  The liquid in the pen that is supposed to fake blood was almost gone.  Also each pen has a sticker on it.  So I\\'m now left taking off each and every one.  First I tried peeling them off and the sticker ripped.  Then I soaked the sticker end in warm water, was able to remove the sticker paper but not the gooey sticky part.  So now I have to get goo off and remove the sticky part.  And all on pens that have only 1/4 of the fake blood in each pen.  What a let down.<br />Can I get a replacement or a refund please?<br />  On a good note...The pen itself seems to work well and the shipping was super fast.\"\\nThese are great BUT they do not last past maybe 2 uses. I\\'ve gone through 3 of them. They start to rip so quickly. I would understand if I weighed 300lbs but I don\\'t far from it.

Then half of those leaked out before we could even throw them. Not worth the price.\\n\"Only received one, not four as shown.  After the order, I got a notice that the number of balloons was reduced by approximately 50.  I should have read more carefully that this came from China.\"\\n\"Was very dissapointed, they looked nothing like the picture showed. Bought some at the dollar tree that looked 100 time better than these did for the same price.\"\\n\"Terrible! Some pieces are warped, broken and missing guides holes.

My grandson played with it and the second day he had it - it broke! He was so upset!\\nit is different with picture. not a doll. you have to change the picture.\\n\"Horrible.  They are extremely small, much smaller than regular army men and had a toxic chemical smell that wouldn\\'t go away.  Threw them in the trash.\"\\n\"I bought one of these brand new for my son and spent more time fixing it than he spent riding it, so I sold it super cheap, having owned it for a little over three months.  I didn\\'t expect this bike to be high quality given the price, but it still didn\\'t meet my expectations. -Less than two weeks after getting the bike, the clutch had to be replaced. -A few weeks after that, one of the fuel lines disintegrated and had to be replaced. -Not too long after that, the pull starter rope broke.  In the process of trying to wind the rope back on (which was another nightmare) one of the springs inside the coil snapped. -Additionally, unless you buy this bike preassembled, the graphics (stickers) are not on the bodywork.  You have to put them on.  The graphics are all flat but go on curved bodywork, so nothing really lays flat and the graphics end up with ridges and folds in them, and dirt gets stuck under them. -The bike has a key, but the ignition is just zip tied somewhere on the bike and prone to be ripped off in a fall.  I moved the ignition to the handlebars to keep it away from the ground. -Finding a dealer who will sell parts for these wasn\\'t easy.   -No chain guide.  The chain just drags along the frame. -There is a screw to govern the throttle but it only has a couple of positions and I couldn\\'t tell a difference between them.  Even unrestricted, at full speed, the bike barely went fast enough to be stable.  Positives about the bike:   -It is really cheap.  If you think of it as a disposable bike, that\\'s not too far from the truth.  We bought this rather than spend $1500-$2000 on a new big name brand bike, in case he fell over a couple of times and was no longer interested.  -It is really light.  I never used a ramp to put it in my truck.  I just grabbed the frame and handlebars and set it in the bed.  This also means it\\'s easy for kids to pick up when they drop it.  Would NOT buy or recommend an SSR product.\"\\n\"I paid $151 for it. Just opened it up and the package (damaged but previously explained) showed seller paid $2.95 for it.<br />I opened it over a year later for grandson s bd, and old enough to play. It had batteries in it ,supposed to be empty, and acid leaked,damaging wire connections, Does not work. Buyer beware of pjnbj97. I should have opened earlier.\"\\nI purchased this item expecting to receive both kickstarter versions for coup and reformation but was disappointed when I found only the reformation kickstarter version. This item is not selling as advertised.\\nIt broke within 1 day of receiving it.\\n\"Was expecting the classic Lego formula here. I was expecting normal, lego-sized pieces with an instruction booklet to build an entire set with the pieces given. They only give you instructions on how to build the first quarter of the miniature world, then leave the rest to you to figure out on your own. Some people might enjoy that, but that\\'s not why I buy Legos.<br /><br />I also was unaware that they really mean \\'MICRO WORLD\\'. The pieces are far smaller than normal Lego pieces, making it a real hassle to put together (and take apart) unless you have the fingers of an 11 year old pianist or a robot.<br /><br />I\\'m an adult who grew up with Legos. Don\\'t give us any more of this crap, please. Thanks.\"\\n\"It was hard to get out the package, it feels like it was wet at one time, and it doesn\\'t even work.:(\"\\nI would give it a ZERO rating if i could...didn\\'t last but a week...not made very good!!!!! don\\'t waste your money\\n\"I got 1/2 of the parts described and pictured.

It has a terrible lean despite multiple attempts to adjust / tighten.  I took it out a few times and had multiple people warn me about the lean while on the bike path.

I really liked it for a while, but it died suddenly after working great for 2 weeks.  I used it while running for about 1 hour/day, so not extensively.  It looks like a cheap piece of junk and it turns out it IS a cheap piece of junk.  For whatever it\\'s worth, below is my original review: I got exactly what was pictured.  I LOVE the small size and light weight.  However, it is very cheaply made and feels like a little toy.  Also, I don\\'t understand why it comes with a USB flash drive when what you really need is a micro sd card. This is what you need (including the adapter): http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-microSDHC-Memory-SDC4-8GBET/dp/B00200K1TS/ref=pd_bxgy_60_img_y It came with no instructions AT ALL.  I first plugged the MP3 into my computer using the cable it came with, only to find that the computer doesn\\'t recognize the unit; the cable/computer is used only to charge the MP3 unit.  Then I figured out (only from reading other reviews) that I needed a micro sd card to upload music onto this thing.  Luckily, I had a micro sd card on hand.  So, after a bit of trial and error, I got it to work.  I am actually pleasantly SHOCKED to find that it works. It looks so ridiculously small and flimsy that I was almost sure it wasn\\'t going to work.  I\\'m giving it 4 stars for now because this is actually exactly as described and works well... for now. I will update my review if and when it breaks.  I would\\'ve given it five stars if they had included instructions and a micro sd card (which would be only logical to include in the package in my opinion).\"\\n\"If I could put less than one star I would. I bought several packs of Thank You cards and these idiots packaged the envelopes already sealed, so I literally ripped through every one trying to open them. Then I had to go through the trouble of finding envelopes to fit the cards.\"\\nNote that this isn\\'t a Star Wars product though the label says STAR WARS. The coloration and design are significantly different.\\n\"Worked for 5 minutes then broke, my grandson spent the next hour crying!!\"\\nThese were not dessert plates but rather dinner plates. I was scrambling at the last minute to buy dessert sized plates.\\nWas very inexpensive but not very well made - more like a toy. Would not recommend.  Was described as novelty hat and it is!\\nVery disappointed in these markers. The eraser pens didn\\'t work. The blow pen pretty much blows a vein in your brain because you have to blow so hard. One of the markers bubbled the paper and turn hard. My granddaughter was excited to see them but that was the only excitement about it. Very cheaply made. Only one star for the smile I got when she saw what she opened\\nI got this item and only the lights work. There is no sound at all. I\\'ve tried replacing the battery and that didn\\'t work. I had already opened the box so I could not return. Disappointed\\nthis is the second puzzle I have bought from Ravensburger. They both had between 20-25 pieces missing! Do not buy this brand of puzzle. Learn from my mistakes!!!?\\nNOT STABLE\\nBOUGHT 4 ESC\\'S ONLY TO HAVE 3 WORK CORRECTLY. I ASKED THE SELLER TO GET ME THE FIRMWARE VERSION SO I COULD RE-FLASH THE ESC. THE SELLER TAKES 9 DAYS TO REPLY SAYING THE ESC\\'S HAVE NO FIRMWARE AND CHECK MY OWN SETTINGS.<br /><br />I ENDED UP BUYING ANOTHER 4 AND GUESS WHAT. AGAIN ONLY 3 WORKING ESC\\'S.<br /><br />POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND POOR QUALITY CONTROL.\\n\"Do not order these!!!  I bought these for my daughter and she was so excited when they came.  She tried to put them on but they won\\'t stay on because the fabric is so thin.  It is PAPER thin - like tissue paper.  There is no structure to these ballet slippers unlike what the photo would imply.  The shoe size is probably size 10/11 but even if your child\\'s foot is that size, I\\'m not sure the shoes will stay on because the fabric is so flimsy and the shoes are so wide.  If you want to return these (7th Avenue is where I ordered it from), it\\'ll cost you a 20% restocking fee or you exchange it for something else they sell but for such a low price item, it\\'s not worth it.  So basically, you\\'re just throwing money away.\"\\n\"I was disappointed from go. First, the trinket box I have is not as pretty (yes, I\\'m aware they probably used professional lighting) and the pretty  accent &#34;stones&#34; are very obviously glued on (I wasn\\'t expecting real, but better than obviously fake). Finally, while the dimensions make it sound reasonable, it is much too tiny on the inside. On the upside, the sea shell and star &#34;imprints&#34; inside are cute.<br />  I\\'m aware my review is harsh, but it\\'s the truth.\"\\nThey came ripped and bend and I was not able to hang them because half of the hangers were missing.\\nI have to put a star because otherwise won\\'t let me express the Very poor quality...

I just wish there were more color options.  Not sure what I\\'m going to do withe the box once the pencils are gone.  All in all not really worth it.\"\\nThis is dollar store quality at best...I was very disappointed..Definitely not worth the price.. My grandson doesn\\'t play hard with his toys and his first day to play with it one of the little men just came apart  trying to put him back in the go cart...a steering wheel came off with no effort and would be a major choking threat..\\n\"I am sure this is a fun toy.  My son played with it at a friend\\'s house when he was younger, and he seemed to like it.  So I bought it for my daughter\\'s first birthday.  I bought it preassembled because after building my son\\'s backhoe loader last year (http://www.amazon.com/Rolly-Backhoe-Loader-Tractor-Yellow/dp/B00091V932) and coming close to shooting myself in frustration, I have decided I\\'ve had it with building kid toys.  Btw, that toy is AMAZING, well-built, and very sturdy.  I highly recommend.<br /><br />First of all, I purchased it on a Sunday (during the day) with Prime.  I figured 2 day delivery would put it there Wednesday at the latest.  No.  No such luck.  Thursday.  The day after my daughter\\'s first birthday.  You know what?  Who cares?  Big deal.  One day.<br /><br />So it came Thursday and my family waited till today (Friday) so I could be home to open it.  My kids LOVED it.  My son pushed my daughter around in it and they were having a BLAST.  We were taking pictures when I noticed that it kept running on only 3 wheels (and sometimes 2).  So I got my daughter out (that was tough - she really likes it) and stood it up on its own and sure enough...the thing is wonky.<br /><br />I flipped it over to see if it was something I could quick fix.  No dice.  Either it was assembled poorly or the parts were already messed up.  The resulting tilt means later anyone who tries to use their feet to power it will always wind up going in circles.<br /><br />I didn\\'t take a picture of my one year old daughter hugging the box sadly as I put it back into the packaging to send back.<br /><br />Lesson learned.  No more preassembled.<br /><br />I bought the little truck with the nightmare reviews about assembly.  I suppose it\\'s the least I can do for my kids.\"\\nNothing like what I expected. Just have to chalk it up as a really bad purchase\\nWe left them in the box and took them on vacation. What a let down. Neither one held air. Tired of having to blw them up every hour so we through them away. Very expensive not worth it. Kids really disappointed\\nIt is a cool game but the artists are all men.  Zero women.  Not a good thing to show children.\\n\"I ordered this screw set twice, once from BT Group and once from Horizon Hobby. Neither had the screws I was looking for (only needed 4 specific screws). Also only had 3 screws for the differential, a bunch of one size there should only be a few of, and not enough of another size where there should have been many! AND there are philips head screws in this kit. Where are they supposed to fit on the Twin Hammers? They don\\'t. This is either a mislabeled product or screws are tossed in without measuring or counting. Search elsewhere for replacement screws!\"\\nThey did not come in a box as shown but instead in a small black pouch and with a different necklace than the chain necklace shown in the picture. The Triforce is black instead of silver and the necklace they sent instead of the metal one is to big to fit into the charms except for the black triforce. I am very disappointed in this purchase.\\nSooooooooo tiny. This was great for my 1 year old niece. Anyone bigger is way to big and just flops off. (My 5 year old & 8 year old)  Dont recommend.

Functional doors: They aren\\'t. Nothing opens, or if it does you almost have to break it to open it.<br />2. The pictures show a free standing car model. This is not true, it arrives on a platform and does not come off. You would have to probably to break it to get it off the platform it\\'s on.<br />3.

It just doesn\\'t look good.<br /><br />I\\'m returning it and I would suggest you skip over this product.\"\\nhad pieces missing\\nThe premise is wonderful bit they don\\'t stay open which means you can\\'t actually throw a ball into the goal.

My daughter wasn\\'t really interested in it for about the first month so it started coming apart without even having that much play.

I hate that every time my daughter wants to move it it something breaks off.<br /><br />Other then that she loves it.\\nI have to send it back because it\\'s interior pack was torn.\\nIt only has 38 pencils in it!!!!! I am very disappointed!!\\n\"These are LOZ brand, but NOT NANOBLOCKS\"\\nGot a pack of one instead of the pack of two that I ordered...\\nJust received these an hour ago and they already falling apart.\\nThis product looks like a great interactive activity for children interested in nature and dinosaurs. Unfortunately after 3 days the plant will develop mold and a horrible odor. With Amazon\\'s return or replace rules it nearly impossible to have this item replace once put together and to put the icing on the cake you were now faced with the result that you sent $17/18 for mold. Hopefully our kit was just a vad one because we followed all instructions and now are left without any good results.\\nNot smooth\\nThis was the most ridiculous product I ever bought. Must read reviews before purchasing. Nothing works I\\'ve spent days trying to get it to work. Bits and pieces will work but only occasionally.\\nToo expensive and when I go to return they want to charge $6 shipping\\nHorrible. Don\\'t waste your money\\nIt broke after the first day\\nPoor value. One package of 5 sheets. Tissue paper looks fine but it is a rip off. Was not clear in the item description.\\nNo English instructions. Instructions are not available online. :-( useless.\\n\"I have been in AA recovery for 11 years now & was looking for a way to show off my medallions as I am proud of what I have accomplished & want to be an inspiration to others if I can.  I thought a necklace where the medallion can be changed each year would be perfect.  It is still a good idea, but this is NOT the necklace to buy.  The hoop unscrews from the chain & the medallion is inserted into the hoop which then does not close all the way, making it impossible to screw the chain back onto the hoop.  The chain can be screwed back onto one side of the closing, but it is likely that eventually the medallion will fall out.  After all I\\'ve gone through to achieve 11 years of sobriety, the last thing I want is to lose my token of that time.  There must be better alternatives elsewhere, but don\\'t waste your money on this one.\"\\nThese were very small and we\\'re not impressive at all when broken open.\\n\"Was excited and happy with this purchase at first.  Was a little challenging to inflate but my 2 year old seemed to really enjoy.  I hooked up the hose and just had the water spray on very low and that seemed fun.  The bottom of the pool was pretty slippery, not sure if that is just the nature of all pools made of this material.  But i went to let the water out of the pool using the bottom release valve for the first time and the valve complete ripped just when opening it. Very cheap, returning.\"\\n\"Not even worth one star! Action figures had poor quality paint job, overspray present. Joints were stationary and did not move. Highly dissatisfied. Then had to pay 25 dollars for return.\"\\nOnly came with half of what you need to build the picture\\nI bought this for my nephew who is 6 years old. At first he was so excited to play with it but then when he tried to pull the trigger the nerf bullets got stuck. It was hard for him to cock the gun. His dad had to help him with it everytime. We decided to return it because it was not worth it to keep it.\\nHorrible!\\n\"These are really quite terrible. As an adult, I had a hard time getting the stamp to appear clearly. You have to be incredibly precise in pressing down and gently rotating the marker. This meant my toddler had no hope of seeing that star she desperately wanted. These are getting tossed.\"\\nI thought this was so cute. Until we put it together. It was very unsteady and i decided to take it back the same day. I don\\'t recommend this to anyone. Way to much money for something like this.\\n\"No instructions, came in a very beat up box and surprise did not work at all. I had to send it back. Buyer beware not a good item at all.\"\\nGreat for the price!\\nVery thin. Tore before we even made it to my daughters play. And we bought it big so the seems would be stressed...\\nTrying to put this together was quite the mess. The instructions are not detailed at all. They show a list of parts (many of which look very similar) and the a picture of what they look like put together. It\\'s not always clear how they were put together. The clips do not attach securely at all and the finished product tends to fall apart if you breathe on it wrong.  *This product was received in exchange for an honest review*\\n\"This is a very small 6 channel heli , and is very fragile, Even minor crashes caused the canopy to fall off every time. It’s held on by tiny magnets. Even after adjusting the trim the copter had a mind of its own, not responding to the controller for some reason it flew in the opposite direction, for example if I wanted it to move forward, it would bank left or right, and crash. For a 6 channel helicopter there are much better less expensive toy copters out there. So glad  I returned it.\"\\n\"You get what you pay for here.  Do not but this item, had it installed and it is not straight as can be seen from the pic. Will be buying a new faucet.\"\\nExtra large and soft huh... That is a straight up lie. It is a flexible plastic and very small.... Not at all what I expected.... I\\'m extremely disappointed.\\n\"I am so frustrated with this product. I think I got a lemon. Quite literally, every time the ball hits the rim, the rim falls off. Hoping I can still return it.\"\\nThis car doesn\\'t come in the color u pick it is way smaller than what it says and it is really Flimsy and breaks easily\\nThis gun sucks so much right when i got it when i cocked it it didn\\'t shoot sucks don\\'t get it its a waste of your money!\\nThis is a scam as it is not a minion blind box which run for around $7-9 at local stores.  Instead it is just a blind bag which are simply $2.99.\\n\"Very disappointed.  The screen is so reflective that in many lighting conditions it\\'s hard to completely see the numbers and grid.  Under optimum conditions, the lines delineating the nine squares from the other vertical and horizontal lines may take time to recognize.  The numbers 5 and 6 as well as 8 and 9 are too frequently hard to identify immediately.  Sudoku under these circumstances isn\\'t an enjoyable, relaxing pastime but a major irritation - and I paid for this &#34;privilege&#34; which is most irritating of all.\"\\nThese swings somehow rip my childrens shirts at the waist. I\\'m not wasting any more clothes they are going in the garbage today!\\n\"This is slow, low power and doesn\\'t produce much bubbles.  The little $10 kid machines work better even though they only take batteries\"\\n\"Nothing to like here. I mean the canopy fit is nice and you can model the tail wheel closed (the instructions don\\'t list the part, but it\\'s on the sprue), but that\\'s about it. The assemblies were boring, the intake on the belly looks disgusting and in my opinion shouldn\\'t have a seperate piece for the lip itself, the instructions are vague and not once is the right side of the plane shown anywhere in them or on the box, they\\'re full of errors, and the nose decal is the worst I\\'ve worked with. Looks like garbage even after hours of work. It\\'s presentable now, sort of, but wretched compared to all my other finished kits, save maybe my very first plastic kit I ever made, an Airfix B-25. And that thing, while trashy, was a product of poor workmanship on my part. I am not nearly the same modeler now as I was when I ruined that B-25, so that makes this decal situation that much more baffling. Was it even made for this plane?!? I\\'m sorry I can get all the seams fit super tight, I know Revell kits weren\\'t designed with that in mind, but it almost seems as if the nose decal was designed to fit around a wider, poorly assembled fuselage instead of a streamlined, tight fitting one. Granted, I didn\\'t have much heart in this build, P-51\\'s don\\'t interest me so much for whatever reason. More of a build I did just to have a Mustang in the WWII collection really. I actually much prefered the P-40B kit, which is not a compliment in any sense. If you don\\'t want a polished kit with a presentable outcome, this kit would be fine. Beginners, a history enthusiast with no serious interest in scale models, kids, gifts to vets... All things this kit is good for. But if you want a pleasant build where you can focus on the subject matter and produce a quality piece of craftsmanship at the end of it, you can do far better. I generally like Revell, some of their kits are fun just to fix up! But this adds yet another strike to my opinion of their pricepoint molds and the company in general. Revampthese molds and up the overall quality of the product please! Obviously you get what you pay for if you take advantage of Revell\\'s significant catalogue of iconic war planes.\"\\nWorst thing ever. must spend years to learn it.\\nbad instructions and missing parts.\\nPurchased for my grandaughter for our pool.  I filled it up with air and by morning the air was all out.  Hopefully it is just a lemon.\\nMuch smaller than expected. The picture makes it look bigger. Still useful for the beach and I still enjoy the look of melissa and doug toys so that why you get 2<br />Instead of 1 star.\\n\"Misleading.  Listing is for only one shovel,  not three shovels.  This is not made clear anywhere in this listing.\"\\nZERO star if I could. I started filling this and right out of the gate it gets a break in the bottom about 2-3 inches long. I managed to patch it with E6000 and clear gorilla tape. Second split happened just as it got full on the other side of the pool and is about 5-6 inches long and went as far as to tear into the bottom material as well. This one is not fixable as it goes from a vertical to a horizontal tear creating a opening that expands to much to hold a seal with the same patch method. Oh did I mention this was the first time filling it up on the first day we got it. Please ignore the other reviews that give it a good review. It is not worth your time and the crying and yelling that will go on when you tell your kids they can not play in the pool after they got all excited.\\nDon\\'t like it\\nThe center rotating piece was broken  after two months. My boy cried and it  was beyond repair. Lesson learned: Buy a quality product as a birthday present.\\nIt was all mest up when i got this. I tried emailing i tried everything but no answer\\n\"This was a rip off. Look elsewhere, way to overpriced.\"\\nI ordered this item and only received 2 monkeys. The bag the monkeys were in was opened on one side.\\nIt broke the first day my nephew used it\\nIt arrived on time!!.. But the whole figure looks awful!!! The paint is all messed up and I can see a finger print on her cape!...  Don\\'t buy this product! Not recommended for WoW fans!\\n\"Bought this as a huge fan of Stargate SG-1, and found that it was missing two pieces.\"\\nDo not buy.  This product shouldn\\'t be sold. Read the reviews - the technology is so poor that it cannot recognize any variance voice which for a child is totally impractical.\\n\"I want to preface my review by saying game opinions are based on each person\\'s enjoyment. You might love this game, I personally do not.  The game components are top notch, the art is simple and the concept isn\\'t hard to pick up.  I have played the base game once and played another game using the expansion. Each time my frustration has been the same. The first 15 minutes you are excited to roll dice and you collect the currency and buy cards. You spend a lot of time waiting to hit the numbers you need and observe as the person with the red cards steals from everyone and you eventually lose.  I don\\'t need to play this ever again. I will choose Catan over this game any day. Similar mechanics and concept.  I know a lot of people who love this game, I encourage you to play a demo before you invest.\"\\nBroke the first time it was used.\\nwe always have to shake it to work. The light always flickers and doesn\\'t stay on.\\n\"Description incorrect. This is a Chinese-made counterfeit cast in zinc. It is NOT iron, it is NOT licensed, it is NOT struck on steel dies. This is a fake. Do not buy.\"\\nthis game is selling for 4 times what it is worth! Try risk instead.\\n\"The sword is exactly as pictured, but it is made from extremely lightweight wood or some sort of styrofoam. It wobbles and bows just being held out straight and seems like it will snap with the slightest provocation. It is is flimsy and far too delicate for a cosplay prop or a toy.<br />Edit: it knocked lightly against the floor ans one of the prongs snapped off. Absolute piece of junk. I regret the purchase.\"\\nVery disappointing. Heard it was a great quadrocopter. The battery was missing with the package.\\nThe guitars deflated maybe and hour after you blew them up. Not a good product. Waist of money.\\nThese do not fit the my emaxx about a inch to short terrible description\\ndid not work.  attempted to fill and it did nothing but spray all the water out all over the ground once they started dropping off.\\nproduct good delivery on time\\nCheaply made and a poor value.\\nReturned.

DO NOT BUY THIS\\n\"Bought this puzzle for my wife while out of town, I get a text saying a soup can puzzle was in the box. Very frustrated!\"\\ndisappoint legs don\\'t move\\n\"disappointed too, they are so tiny and look cheap, low quality. Kids may excited but throw them later,cause the quality of plastic is very poor. all can\\'t be used.\"\\n\"I, too, did not get what i paid for. It was supposed to be new and the sticker on the back of the box said Like New, whIch it wasn\\'t. Plus it was not the picture of what had been shown and the box was green.\"\\n\"These toys didn\\'t even make it 48 hours with us before half of the arms and legs had popped off. Kids can be rough with toys, this is I know. But other than dollar store toys I have never had anything fall apart so quickly. Not impressed. So we had our TMNT for about a day and a half and now we have none.\"\\nHer hair is a mess and she is freaky\\n\"$75?! I understand they are loder and hard to come by, but come on! its a toy for crying out loud!\"\\nDoesn\\'t Glow in the dark.\\nIt arrived missing pieces and I had to find an alternative gift for my grandchild\\n\"Giving this a 1/5 because of breaking plastic connector parts. In just a couple of weeks, a few of the tight-fitting plastic joints broke apart, which makes it hard to play with and actually transform the toy. This is also fairly complex to transform for young children, but doable. (3-4 years old). I hope Hasbro will adjust their manufacturing process to make these parts break apart less easily.\"\\nArrived and works well but very heavy bc its made out of rubber....like your car tires. For adults and not small kids\\nDoes not charge Note 4 phones or tablets consistently.\\nVery bad mic inside not at all clear very dissatisfied\\n\"Horrible replacement... weak aluminum, and rounded out quick.\"\\nNot made very well.\\nWas stained!\\nIt didn\\'t meet my expectations. I would like to return it\\nMy son loves it BUT it\\'s already falling apart and it\\'s not even 2 weeks old. The THIN tires are getting holes and the battery won\\'t stay connected.  Plus it just feels really cheap and is going to fall apart.  We had a fisher price corvette for a year and didn\\'t have any of these problems we are having.  Plus there is a white powder coming from the battery. It\\'s in the car where the battery goes and on the shelf where the battery sits to charge.\\n\"The pic shows both kinds of food, but I ordered 4 and they all came with green veggies. My daughter wants the banana-apple kind too, but there isn\\'t any.\"\\nRetainer does not fit the Hero4 and scratched up my new GoPro trying to figure it out. Turns out aluminum may not be the best material. As mentioned screws are of a different size than the mfg. I think this is only a problem because the designer could have thought of this and saved everyone a small headache.<br /><br />Did not fit. Had to tape my camera to gimble to get through shoot. Screws were too short even if I had been able to get the retainer to get around my camera. Just plain disappointed.\\nthe planchette was too heavy the board only worked using a shot glass instead.\\n\"Broke the first day she opened it, I asked to send it back and needed another box and missed the deadline to get it in the mail so now my daughters only gift is trash.  Can\\'t get any sound or picture....just a blank screen!  This was a bad purchase.  Spend your money wisely, invest in a little better quality especially if your child has their heart set on a karaoke...  My daughters heart is broken!   Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased!  It was my daughters only christmas gift and it never worked!!!  Junk!!!\"\\n\"The box, and the item description say classic game. NO WHERE  does it say this remake of the classic has been GREATLY downsized, and there is  NO warning to buyer. This version is probably 50% smaller than original size.It looks and performs fine, BUT Really dislike being tricked.\"\\n\"If I could give 0 stars I would. Box arrived ripped and scotch taped closed, pencils were obviously used, one tip was completely broken off, and 1 pencil was missing.\"\\nI didn\\'t get the right one.\\n\"I ordered two dozen. I received two differently made kind, one dozen one way and one dozen another...meaning one dozen was poorer quality than the other.

Would not recommend this to anyone.\"\\n\"Just be sure you don\\'t loose any parts, while FoF says they will replace smaller parts, this is not exactly true.

Needless to say,  I\\'m unimpressed.\"\\nSome of the cutouts were not of aviation. They were not anything..just squares or weird shaped. My son was disappointed. Would not recommend.\\nThis battery sucks it exploded after about 6 charges and I did everything right to charge it\\n\"I received my batteries yesterday. One of the six had a loose ground, so that\\'s one down. None of the included batteries would charge on the six bay charger they came with!

I was shocked to find out there was a 20% restocking fee from the seller if I want to return it, so I will have to keep this garbage toy! Just a piece of junk, it doesn\\'t even close or open properly, very flimsy handle as well.  FOA should pull this manufacturer and supplier. Expected much better for the price that I paid! Packaging was ridiculous too, just thrown into a box, and there were finger prints all over it!\"\\nWe bought this for my nephew with autism. His brother had lost Leonardo from his current set; so he would no longer play with his favorite toys because they were not a complete set. The package came with two Michaelangelo figures and was missing Leonardo.\\n\"I will say not bad looking. That\\'s where the good part stops. Right out of the shipping box the, helicopter\\'s box looked like it had been on a shelf for a few years. That\\'s judging from the amount of dust stuck to it with all the fingerprints in the dust. when I pulled it out the front LED light was missing. I know the description said it was new. That must mean never opened. This thing does great as far as taking off and going straight up. The flight stick spins the body in circles both directions. The forward and back movements are to make you feel good about yourself as they don\\'t work at all. All but 3 buttons on the controller are decorations. I think I\\'ll have to wait for a windy day so I can see what it will look flying in which ever direction it\\'s blowing that day.\"\\nI\\'m a collecter of pop dolls and when I received this doll the box was all damaged now as a perfectionist i want these boxes tip top. So when I received this I was shocked one corner was crumpled to an extreme as I studied it more I realized there was rips in the box which I was very disappointed about. You can tell this was opened very violently because the top flap was ripped so was the bottom. The box is  ripped the figure was poorly kept as for my expectation. The image looked amazing which I thought it would be but sadly it wasn\\'t. So before you buy this item make sure you read the reviews cause I didn\\'t and I sure do regret it.\\nI was the most disappointed customer because when I opened it the head lights in the back did not work and the range for the antenna was about 2 feet and after that it didn\\'t want to reverse and then it didn\\'t want to work at all I didn\\'t even bother too contact the seller because I was so mad\\nvery small game for little children\\nThe music stopped playing in about a month and the dress was falling apart in just a few hrs of play.\\n\"This deck is out of date and isn\\'t even close to the price the only H.A.T deck being played right now is Hands,Aquaactress,Traptrix\"\\nIt came with a leg broken\\n\"Warning: I contacted Learning Resources to inquire about BPA in this product.

I was really hopeful for this RC car to test out a really cool project I\\'m working on for school. Amazon sent me an email saying the product was delivered and I couldn\\'t wait the rest of the day to get home and try it.<br /><br />First awful thing was the packaging. All of the zip ties securing the thing down were broken and it was most definitely thrown around during shipping. No big deal right? Well maybe, this thing was made to handle a beating, so I was hopeful that it would be fine.<br /><br />It didn\\'t come with AA batteries but I was too anxious to try it out on my own, so I scavenged some batteries from an old quadcopter remote control I had lying around and turned the thing on. The thing wouldn\\'t move at all! I flipped the channels around and tried again and still nothing.<br /><br />I later discovered that the steering worked and If I gave the thing a little push it would crawl forward at maybe 1mph. If I tried to change directions or turn during this the whole thing would stop working again until I gave it another push.<br /><br />Now, I know what your thinking &#34;Hey, those were old batteries, go get some new ones and try again.&#34; - Yeah, I know, It still didn\\'t work. I went to target and bought some Duracell AA batteries in a 24 pack (A fairly good deal for $15 but now they\\'re all going to waste). I put in the new batteries, and guess what? Same results. The thing only moves with a push.<br /><br />So normally during this point I will go to amazon and get an exchange. Because all the reviews are decent. But with the packaging, the build quality, and my experience I\\'m just going to get a refund. On top of that all the 5 star reviews are \\'unbiased vine reviews for a free product\\'.<br /><br />I could rave on about the terrible build quality, but I\\'m going to stop here.\"\\nSeam broke within 5 minutes\\n\"Has no relevance to the show, TVD.

I was super excited about trying this product. We came across the kinetic sand at Lakeshore and my Autistic son fell right in love with it. But it just was out of my price range. I went home and searched Amazon. And thought ok I will give this a try. I should have listened to the other reviewers. This product was hard like when brown sugar gets hard but a bit harder. Both packages, I bought two of these came that way. And the shipping weight on here says a pound. This is nowhere near a pound. The two I bought together might have been a pound. But one is not a pound. So I mashed it and mashed it till I could get most the clumps out of it. And I had bought an add on same brand I think. Just a bigger box and it was not hard like this. I should have bought two of those add ons and could kick myself. Because these ones were a complete joke. So I mixed it with that to give it more moisture. And it started taking on the appearance of a kinetic type sand. It is soft enough to where my son will now play with it. before he would not touch it because it was too hard. And I bought this for his sensory table. So it is irritating. With it all added up I could have just bought the real thing. But I thought I was getting more and a better deal. Lesson learned. Just stick to name brands with certain things. I wanted that kinetic sand sensory experience for him. I should have not went cheap. In fact, I could have made my own with sand and baby oil for cheaper. Oh and the smell. I may have to toss this all in the end. It has a bad smell. And he keeps frowning. If he ends up not using it based off of the smell alone due to his Autism. I just wasted money for sure. If you have a special needs child DO NOT BUY THIS. just get the real stuff or make your own so it smells good. The name brand never smelled like this though.\"\\n\"My  8 year old grandson visited me with this toy.As he was playing, he hurt his thumb with the heavy ball as it dropped down. I can only imagine a child getting hit in the face with the ball as they toss it up, or even worse, breaking a tooth. This toy is DANGEROUS.\"\\n\"My kids were so excited to get these shoe charms for their crocs before our trip to Florida.  Within the first day they had already fallen off or the characters had completely torn off.  Every charm they tried to wear, was torn or fell off by the end of the day.  Maybe these would be okay on the bracelets, but are horrible shoe charms.  They ended up just buying jibbitz in Orlando.\"\\n\"I gave it one start because we got one day out of it before it crashed and broke. The directions were written with some sort of translator because you can scarcely understand their intent because of the word order and typos. Anyway,  I ordered the Canopy 2-Year Toys Accidental Protection Plan ($50-$75) , we\\'ll see if it is worth it\\'s salt. My 9 year old is bummed. This was a birthday present.\"\\n\"Avoid this item -- it\\'s a very poor design! And worse, if you don\\'t follow the instructions you will almost certainly strip the threads where the only screw included is supposed to go.  Sadly, this product COMES WITHOUT ANY INSTRUCTIONS -- and doesn\\'t even inform you that they exist or even that they have a website.  They do:  &#60;http://www.step2.com/p/Play-Shade-Pool&#62;.  And on the website (but not with the package) it says &#34;Most of our assembly instructions are available in PDF format on our website.&#34;  I\\'m an engineer with a PhD and I couldn\\'t figure out how to assemble it properly until I discovered how to get the instructions: http://images.step2.com/media/pdfs/716000_assembly.pdf  The instructions are primarily the usual pages of warnings not to do all the things only idiots would do.  The rest is a minimum of text and lots of obscure pictures.  Pictures #4 and #5 are critical -- make sure you understand them because if you don\\'t you will probably strip the threads, a danger even if you do assemble it correctly (the plastic around the screw is extremely soft).  And by the way, when I tried to write a review for this product on their website, I couldn\\'t change the pre-selected five-star rating, so I of course didn\\'t leave the review.  Needless to say the reviews online (all 5-star) are not a fair sampling of opinion.  Disclaimer: we did not buy this product through Amazon.\"\\n\"It was the worst item I have ever purchased for my RC car. No matter what I tried, loctite, silicone, and just plain over tightening, it still loosened up and nearly fell off the truck after about 10 minutes of run time. It looks and sounds great, but it just won\\'t stay on the truck. Don\\'t waste your money like I did.\"\\nThe plane came broken as soon as I opened it. I tried to return it but only got half of my money back.\\n\"The figures included in this set were the characters pictured, however, the quality was extremely poor. The paint job on each was careless and messy. Many of the figures couldn\\'t stand up because they were misshapened. The bottom line is that they were produced to make a buck off of the minion craze. Save your bucks on this pack.\"\\nNot Worth The Risk. Props Aren\\'t made for DJI Phantom 2 I used them on my stock setup expecting bigger thrust and higher maneuverability but I got the opposite. Descending was a major issue you practically couldn\\'t Descend without the Phantom wobbling and being extremely unstable even while moving forwards or backwards to get out of your own turbulence. flew 3 times and the quad was less stable when it game to GPS Lock then my 4th flight as I was descending and moving forward the Quad went into a HUGE wobble and thankfully recovered only to be thrown into the ground from 60ft by the wobble reoccurring again at that point I let go of all controls and watch my Quad hit the asphalt. I will never use any carbon prop again. I should have listened to the other complaints from fellow pilots. DO NOT BUY\\nReturned chair!  Did not like the quality.\\nWould not go together ! I wish I would have never got it\\n\"This is a horribly made toy.  It broke within 10 minutes of my son who is 9 playing with it.  The front axel and wheels don\\'t turn right.  The bumper is falling off.  The body is aluminum the shell and bumpers are a cheap plastic.  If you are looking for a display item this would be perfect but don\\'t take it out of its plastic air might destroy it.  If you are looking for a toy your child can hold and roll this way to expensive - cheaply made toy is not for you or your child. Disappointment will be the result, that sure was ours.\"\\n\"I wish I could have given this a 5 star. But the 1 star ball I received wasn\\'t in the normal box like the other two. it was in a little plastic container, as well the 1 star is off center. EDIT: Twice I have received this ball and twice has it been off center and in a flimsy little package. Attached are two pictures, 1 showing the correct package and 1 showing the 2 off center 1 star balls.\"\\n\"Misleading instructions, there is no paint. Pieces are flemsy and the seller is a jerk. DO NOT BUY THIS THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER PRODUCT OUT THERE.\"\\nIt will not stay on my ear! my ears arent BIG! so idk whats the issue??? any suggestions?....So far its been a WASTE of money!\\nSwitch went bad in a week. No longer turns on. Absolutely waste.\\n\"This is our 3rd generation of leapfrog games that we\\'ve purchased for our kids over the last 5 years, the first being an explorer. The older 2 games still work great and have held up, we just wanted the new bells and whistles! This version is a joke. Bought 2 as Christmas gifts, one lasted maybe a month, and I made sure my kids treated them carefully. It appeared to have a cracked screen -- just like some of the pictures posted by other reviewers. Not a kid tough toy at all. So I contacted leapfrog and they were helpful, to a degree. I received a new game and that one worked well for a couple of weeks then one day when my daughter went to play it it had a screen message to plug it in and connect to leapfrog connect. What the what?? I tried, I contacted LF, they told me to uninstall and reinstall etc etc. long story short wasted a lot of time trying to \\'fix\\' the new one and now we have 2 pieces of expensive junk that don\\'t work. I gave up trying. So don\\'t waste your time. Oh we still do have the second one from Christmas, it mostly works ok I suppose. But it is slow, freezes frequently, and frankly the kids have forgotten about it because my younger one was so distraught that hers didn\\'t work anymore but her older sisters did, that I took it out of circulation. Save your $ and yourself a major headache.\"\\n\"Tiny, flimsy, fell apart right away.\"\\ndown right rip off\\nrange was about 8 ft. i know that it was cheap but not that cheap.\\n\"Just ordered this same thing from Walmart.com, very pleased with products but paid $200 less.\"\\nVery cheap material. Could not get it to fly. Would not buy again.\\n\"Smallest props that I have purchased via amazon. They are so small and cheap that I could never use them for any of my clients.  Buyer beware. If you own a photo booth, don\\'t buy!\"\\n\"Not original! The proportions are all wrong, this is a cheap copy.\"\\n\"I love Metal Earth models, I made almost 30 of them and I was never disappointed. When I got that Castle, I was surprised to find out that it was not Metal Earth. Still, I started the assembly. It was a mistake. The quality of metal is just bad. Not always, but in some cases when you try to bend the tab it simply falls apart at the first touch (with Metal Earth models sometimes I was making mistakes, and it was not a problem, I was always able to twist the tabs back, remove the detail and attach it again correctly, I even made the rule - always to twist in the same direction so it would not be a problem to re-attach). One balcony lost half the railings when I just touched it with a finger while it was still on a metal sheet. The third of angle pieces on the roofs were gone when I just tried to insert tabs near them. If I would order that thing as my first Metal Earth model, I would never buy another.<br />The links on package and instructions set point to the website of that fake maker, without any 3D picture (which is available on Fascinations.com).<br />What I noticed: that was the first item that was delivered to me from China, not from US. I also ordered Sydney Opera house, it was also sent from China - and it is not Metal Earth as well (I did not open it yet).\"\\n\"I, too, hardly ever write product reviews, but this one was so bad and disappointing that I couldn\\'t resist.  Wife bought this as a surprise gift for our granddaughter. A surprise is exactly what she got. Two words - it sucks.  Paid $7, which was $7 too much. The box and documents say it spins for a long time, but wouldn\\'t spin, let alone stay spinning, for spit. Paints are too messy, as is the inside of the box after a couple of uses. Paints should be vegetable based so they wash off hands and out of clothes easier.  I can\\'t say enough bad things about this product. Worth much less than one star. Take this piece of advice - RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!  Do NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!\"\\nparts were missing\\n\"Poor directions and quality, Very disappointed and will not put this on my train layout.\"\\n\"We got this for our son\\'s 5th birthday (the package indicates it\\'s for ages 5 and up). He is NOT a rough-and-tumble guy, and the tail still broke off the Dino after 2 days of play. My son playfully tugged on the tail, and it fell off and disintegrated into segments-- revealing that it had only been held onto the Dino by 4 loops of thin thread and some cheap plastic connectors. See my photo.<br /><br />I can\\'t imagine what would happen if a child, say, threw the Dino across the room or pretended to have it &#34;fight&#34; another child\\'s toy.<br /><br />The Dino\\'s various tricks and habits are amusing, and in motion, it does look and sound like a real animal. But what\\'s the point if it can\\'t be played with? I\\'d save this for a teen robotics fan or an adult who mainly uses it as a desk toy at work.\"\\ntoo fuzzy dont work well at all\\nBroke within the first hour.\\n\"It popped on the first day of use.  We kept it away from sharp objects, only inflated to a smaller amount than the 3 feet so it would have less chance of popping, and kept it out of the sun.  Very disappointed.\"\\n\"the item is too expensive for the quality.  Something you could probably find in a $.99 cent store.  Also, there are not very many inserts for cards and the ones that are in the book are actually too small for regular Pokemon cards.  My granddaughter, whom it was purchased for is very unhappy with the item.  I did request to return it for a refund, but found that if I was to do so it was going to cost more than half the price paid for the item. Therefore, I decided to keep rather than hassle with return.\"\\nProduct Description and box both state - real feel ball - NO BALL CAN IN BOX\\nPulled on it a couple times and it broke.

I am hesitant to put the other one on due to same reason.I have to say I\\'m disappointed..this decal is the cover of one of my favorite albums.Sorry, but I will not buy another one.\"\\nDO NOT BUY Did not receive As many pieces as advertised. They are of VERYYYYY CHEAP quality. The Apple and Knife were already broken when we received them.  It is not even worth the pain to return them.\\nNo good\\n\"This is an extremely small item. If you drop these items, chances are they will disappear, especially into a rug. In their defense, the magnets are very powerfull for their size.\"\\n\"I am so disappointed with this product.  Immediately upon opening, I was hit with the horrible chemical smell.  After manipulating the pieces for a few minutes, I developed a headache and nausea from the fumes.  After putting the puzzle outside and moving to another area in my house, I remained sick for over an hour.  I was unable to find specifics about the components making up this product but there is no way these chemicals are safe.  The label confirms that it was made in China.  I just want to point out that I have other quality foam toys made by other companies that do not have this awful toxic smell so I know it is not just a necessary effect of the production process.   The puzzle itself is cute, but I can\\'t give it any more than one star since it made me physically ill.  UPDATE:  I have had the puzzle for about 7 weeks.  During this time, I left the puzzle pieces, unassembled, in an open paper bag in the garage to allow it to off gas. After about 3 weeks, I brought it into the house and the smell was still strong enough to make me sick.  I soaked the pieces in warm soapy water and the fumes were unchanged.  (Not surprising but worth a try).  Now, after 7 weeks, the smell is ALMOST gone.  I\\'m still not sure about the safety of the product, even with the smell greatly decreased.  I plan to air it out another month before allowing into my home again.   On a side note, I also purchased the Lauri puzzle with the kids standing in different positions and it too was made in China with the toxic smelling stuff.\"\\nSave your money. Did not work as advertised even after sending three units...don\\'t buy!\\nThis is the absolute worst purchase I\\'ve ever made on Amazon. Trash. Poor quality. I was embarrassed when my grandaughter tried to play with them.\\nThis is a total waste of money!\\n\"Well, overall this was a disappointment. Sure, you can &#34;bake&#34; with thing alright, but it\\'s nothing like what you see on the box. The package of &#34;cookie&#34; mix is a complete joke -- it\\'s more like pixie dust. You mix this dust with water to make &#34;cookies&#34;, and you are supposed to get 12  cookies out of one packet of mix. Well, to make that many cookies, they would be about a 1/4 serving size portion of dinner for Barbie. Really. Barbie could eat all 12 of these so-called cookies for dinner and still be hungry. Additionally, I call the mix you get with this thing pixie dust because I\\'m not really sure what\\'s in it -- a little fluff and a dash of magic and some great marketing for some horrible tasting Tinker Bell sized cookies. Not to mention the refill packets are more expensive than just buying the pre-ready cookie dough rolls at the store; the ovens you put in a real oven really are cheaper. If you\\'re little ones wants to bake, I say give them some premade break-apart cookies, let them turn on the oven and put the cookies on a sheet, and viola! Your kids will be happy with a much better tasting result.\"\\n\"Did not hold up, even first time assembled. Junk.\"\\n\"This is not durable at all. I took it out of the box, put the flimsy thing together, blew on it to take it down, and out right back in the box to return it. If your child has any moment in time where they\\'re at all a little rough, this thing will be toast. The accessories, too.\"\\nWay too small\\nThese are pick up trucks not monster trucks. Looks nothing like the picture. If you\\'re looking for what\\'s in the picture DO NOT BUY!<br />Attaching picture of what was received. I returned the product once only to receive the same thing again!\\nThe pool does not stay inflated. Air leaks out of two of the three air chambers - we weren\\'t able to use this pool even once! Very disappointing - I would not recommend this product.\\nDO NOT BUY!! These cards are horrible! There\\'s about 7 cards alone that have 7 duplicates!\\n\"sucks, waste of money\"\\n\"I\\'m very disappointed in this hat. I don\\'t know if the company tried making the hats bigger due to other reviewers stating that this hat ran small, but I ordered for my 6 year old step daughter\\'s pirate dress up day at camp and just received it to find out it\\'s not only way too large for her head, it\\'s even loose on mine and my husband\\'s head!!!! A complete waste of money.\"\\n\"Terrible. The best part is the canvas bag. Has a nice drawstring so you can easily close and open it. And it shows. Ordered two bags, and ALL 40 of the nickels were from 1900 to 1907. Only 4 out of 40 were VG-8, the rest were G-4 or worse. The COA that comes with it says all nickels are certified VG or better. The bags have been deliberately gone through, it seems. The years in the title of the refer to the years in which this nickel design was minted, not what comes in the bag.\"\\nThese were going to decorate my grandson\\'s 2nd birthday cake until i saw them yes I knew they would be tiny but they were so poorly made the details of paint and plastic were all so mixed up the face color was all messy they looked like little globs of plastic mistakes not monkeys.\\nVery disappointed in the packaging. this was bought for my daughters 4th birthday and the box was all torn apart and I was also under the impression that came with both of the dolls. After receiving it I read into it a little more and realized that it does say dolls sold separately  but it is very deceiving with both the dolls  in the picture and not only that but it didn\\'t let me pick which one of the dogs I wanted so you would think if it was coming with one of the dogs you would get to pick if you wanted the one with the brown hair or the blonde hair pretty deceiving and a load of crap in my opinion\\n\"Should have followed my gut while reading other reviews but I wanted so badly for this product to work. Does not &#34;blow&#34; bubbles, I\\'ve tried everything and nothing has worked so far. If anyone has suggestions, I\\'m open to hearing them. Luckily my daughter likes to push it around anyway but being a typical child that LOVES bubbles, this was a huge disappointment to us all :(\"\\n\"DO NOT PURCHASE:  thought it looked cute for 6 year old girl.  Opened the package and the bracelets stink like some kind of petroleum product, and I mean they stink really bad.  Let them sit out for hours and they still smell.  Cheap purchase so will not return, will use for starter fuel next time I have a bonfire.\"\\ndid not fit any dolls we own\\nI wish I could buy it but it\\'s way too ridiculously over priced.\\nPiece of junk. It broke within 5 minutes of my daughter opening it for her 2nd birthday. What a bummer!\\nhad to get a replacement due to the seal between the sides and the bottome were leaking and then the replacement did the same thing!  I was ver disappointed.\\nballoons were stuck so some of them didn\\'t blow up because of pin holes\\n\"Response was very quick. However, I had to return because I didn\\'t realize I was ordering a small scale train car.\"\\n\"Train barely moves around track, won\\'t complete 1 rotation. Won\\'t  pull a car with it. Changed batteries 3 times in case there was something wrong with them; didn\\'t change performance.\"\\n\"sound is very low hardly heard,not matching expectations\"\\nSuch a disappointment!!! Not as pictured.  She has a tiny head. A hard music box imbedded in her back. Smaller in size than pictured. Her face looks lifeless. I have a sleeping doll that\\'s precious this one is not. She looks dead.\\nIt was missing a piece.\\nexpected something else\\nDid not take good pictures maybe too old\\n\"not well made, ripped within 5 minutes\"\\n\"did not realize it was the small ball,get the bigger one\"\\nDon\\'t fill ahead of time 😩.\\nMine didnt come with a wheel\\nBattery came with a leak and worked only once and water got inside the battery. Terrible design.\\nThese glowsticks leaked upon putting them on our children.  Amazon quickly refunded us.\\n\"These fell apart as expected but we were facing a 106 degree outdoor wedding and needed something quick! No, I wouldn\\'t buy these again and if you have time for shipping and a few extra bucks - buy something else.\"\\n\"What a disappointment. First off, it looked amazing. I saw the 3.0 version on indiegogo and didn\\'t want to wait so I bought the 2.0 and this was a horrible mistake on my part.<br /><br />It came in and I followed the directions to assemble the drone, battery and camera. It wanted to drift regardless of the adjustments I made which was a bummer but THE MAIN ISSUE IS THE QUALITY OF THE WIRING.<br /><br />I flew it for a total of 2 minutes and since there isn\\'t an on/off switch you have to unplug the battery. I did - then today I plugged it in and noticed that it would only light up if the wires were jiggled (obviously a break in the solder or something). I know it\\'s price is attractive but I\\'m really disappointed in the overall quality. I wish I had waited for the 3.0 version which from the commercial...seems to be better.<br /><br />Now I\\'m returning this one and I got to throw away shipping costs :(\"\\nDo not order this item . The boucy balls looked used and the seams were poorly made. The balls even had nicks and dents in them. They were only 12 in the bag. The description never told us how many. I returned them\\nLooks nuthing like the pic\\n\"CHEAP, bought this for my sons birthday and terribly disappointed all of them broke within 2 days, don\\'t waste your money\"\\n\"Wanted to change the little propellers to a different color, drone broke when I tried removing the 2nd propeller. I have 2 of the same drones & change things all the time with no problems.\"\\nTiny cheap way over priced.\\n\"Color as expected, not very sticky and it is not stretchable to do curves. Very dissatisfied with it, waste of money.\"\\nI honestly think it would have been better as plastic\\nIt\\'s small and hard to blow up.\\ndont buy it it is a peice of garbage i opened it and it was already broken. i ordered a replacement broke on its second flight no crashes.\\nArrived broken and useless.  Too much trouble to return.\\nFound the same one at the dollar store  $1 ...\\nLooked bad.  We returned it.\\nThis product should be taken off of the market. I had five excited kids quickly turn disappointed. The balloons deflated within 5 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous. ZERO STARS!!!\\n\"Cute, but definitely not fitting as a one size fits all as manufactured\"\\n\"Very disappointing that we received a product with puzzle image that is different from what we purchased. We specifically ordered this puzzle because my daughter wanted Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy, and Toddles was an added plus... instead we received a different puzzle with Mickey, Minnie, and Donald and my daughter asked where is Goofy.\"\\ni cant believe this I ordered this two times and both times I got ripped off\\n\"Ordered 2, received 2, but 1 was totally broken into pieces\"\\nCreepy as all hell\\nIt is toooooo small\\nDo not waist your money they look so cheap like something you can get from the dollar store the paint was chipped and a couple of them had there arms off which I did put back on but they would always fall off\\nNot durable for young children at all! I am Actually on the second one of these. Fabric rips easily and the cardboard bends easily and does not pop back to its shape\\nDon\\'t waste your money. The ties aren\\'t tight enough so the balloons lose all their water. I think maybe 2-3 worked out of the bunch.\\n\"I  can\\'t even begin to tell you how terrible this purchase was. All figures were in pieces when they arrived and when my son tried to assemble  them back together, the pieces would not fit or match up eith each other. Did not come with an invoice or return info. Only reason for 1 star is it wouldn\\'t let me submit without one. Definitely recommend NOT buying from this product.\"\\nDon\\'t buy this.  Very cheap and oversized\\nThese are horrible. Not even fake leather they are spandex. And the straps on them were barely glued on foam. My son liked them but they were terrible.\\n\"This item is not Deer By the Cabin, it is a puzzle of a ship.<br />I was going to buy, but seller says he does not have the deer puzzle.<br />The description and picture do not match.\"\\n\"they broke really easy, was not impressed with them\"\\nYou get what you pay for!\\n\"Received it today,doesn\\'t go around,just makes siren etc noises .very disappointed !\"\\nThere were 4 earrings missing from closed packs. I couldn\\'t give it as a gift as I intended.\\nVery disappointed as pieces were missing.  Postage to return is too much for such a cheap item!\\nToo bad\\n\"This is a shoddy no-name toy of the type sold in dollar stores. It\\'s worth maybe $2 or $3 at most; it even comes in a plastic bag labeled &quot;TOYS&quot;.<br /><br />It\\'s made of regular plastic, not fiberglass. It comes with garish stickers already applied; the wings and tail need to be snapped on. It\\'s got lumpy chromed wheels, the two halves of the body don\\'t fit together perfectly, the wings are loose in their sockets and droop, and one had an engine already broken off.<br /><br />It looks like the rest of it would break or fall apart the first time a kid played with it - and that\\'s all it\\'s good for; it\\'s certainly not a model/replica that you would want to preserve or proudly display.<br /><br />The only good things I can say are that the proportions look like a real airliner (except for the friction motor and wheels) and it has molded-in details that add some realism, like the windows, doors, wing flaps, etc.<br /><br />P.S. You can see most of the problems mentioned above if you zoom the product photos and look carefully.\"\\nJunk.  Worked for less than a week.\\nReceived completely different model than pictured. So disappointed.\\nThese arrived melted and unusable =(\\nRipped a huge hole on the first time out with the kids.

Waste of money.\"\\n\"I ordered these for my kids birthday party, for party favors.  When I ordered them, there was a different picture posted.  These arrived and I was utterly disappointed.  I really wouldn\\'t have cared that they looked different than the initial picture, but the fact was - what I received was cheaply made and looked it.  We\\'ve gotten these at parties before and the arms are always off and lost within an hour.  However, Amazon was great and in an online chat session, they found me what I needed, overnighted them to me (it was already the Thursday before the party), and\"\\nI believed I was getting a holo but it was in reverse instead\\n\"One of the drum covers was adhered to the base loose, unable to bongo.\"\\nOverpaid!!!\\nActually I doubt that intensity is 20 A.

They also smell awful.  Extremely disappointed!\"\\nAwful experience.  First time we ordered during the break in process it started smoking and wouldn\\'t stop so we had to send in for a new one.  Now that we have the second one it\\'s been one broken part after the other. If a tire isn\\'t falling off then something needs adjusted.  It\\'s hard to steer straight and if it goes off a smooth surface you can gaurantee you will need to fix something.

After having to Google what most of the cards even meant, I got rid of about 2/3 of the cards, which all dealt with heinous sexual acts. Not exactly a game about who\\'s the most adventurous!\"\\n\"They fell apart almost immediately.  The price was cheap, and they were not worth it.

Not to mention these batteries are wider and shorter than the battery that came with the quadcopter, making them a very tight fit in the quadcopter putting strain on the wires inside.<br /><br />Do not order these batteries, they are not exact replacements, they are some knock-off battery that will barely work and will not last you more than 1 week.<br /><br />EDIT: Both batteries are completely dead now and will not hold any charge whatsoever.

That is the only reason I didn\\'t return it, because they could say we damaged it. I can;t imagin how mad I would have been if it had been a gift.

Definitely will be returning can get it at the dollar store\\nPoor quality plastic. The item looks a lot different than the featured pucture too.\\n\"I got this for my son for his 7th birthday.

Changed the batteries and even tried a new remote... Nothing:(\"\\n\"It didn\\'t come with the seeds! So now I have this tiny little egg planter, and too very not happy cats.

Five of the six had one or more pieces missing!!  Never buy brand again.\\nHat was squished to hell and back.\\nThere is nothing quick or easy about refilling a water balloon kit.  Each individual balloon needs to be threaded thru a tiny rubber washer.  I gave up after 30 mins and only having 15 balloons replaced.  Not worth the time.\\n\"We received this as a gift, and it was well loved. The batteries eventually died, and I finally got around to replacing them. I used NiMH batteries (which are approved for this product per the manual). In went the new batteries, I tested the toy, it turned on just fine, so I put the battery case lid back on and put the battery case back inside the soft body of the toy. I tried to turn it back on, but it wouldn\\'t turn on, so I took the battery case back out to investigate (the switches are difficult to see when the case is inside the soft body), and that is when I noticed a burning plastic smell, and that the lid of the battery case was hot to the touch! I frantically unscrewed the two small screws in the case, and once I got it open, I could see visible sparks at the negative terminal end of one of the batteries (and it was NOT installed incorrectly). I was able to pull the battery out, though it was extremely hot to the touch, and removed the other batteries as well. The spring at that terminal end was blacked and compressed, where it had just been perfectly normal before I put the new batteries in. The plastic surrounding the spring was melted and brown.<br /><br />A quick google search revealed this has happened to many others, but that there is no recall on this product. And coming here to Amazon to see other reviewers saying the same thing, well, clearly something needs to happen to fix this problem. It seems to happen only when batteries are replaced (and immediately after they\\'re replaced), but it could potentially cause burns or a catastrophic fire! IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU, REPORT IT TO FISHER PRICE! I called Fisher Price (888.253.4303) and the woman I spoke with was extremely helpful and apologetic. She emailed me a prepaid shipping label, and will be mailing me a check for the full retail value of the toy (and even said if I should find it for more than the check\\'s value, to call and they will refund the difference as well). Evidently there are newer versions of this toy with only two batteries, instead of three (it is the three battery version which is having this malfunction, or so it would seem). I also filed an incident report with saferproducts.gov.ersions of this toy with only two batteries, instead of three (it is the three battery version which is having this malfunction, or so it would seem).

There is not enough power sent to the motor to do anything indoors with any type of indoor lighting with standard light bulbs. I had to actually use a small desktop halogen light bulb and place it directly above the solar panel to make the motor move. Concept is good but quality is poor.

I got it all set up and the lighting is super dim, even with the lights off in the bathroom it\\'s not very bright, and by 6 different light shows it means it slowly cycles through 6 different colors......slowly....and it really is chep plastic.

First, out of the box the sound quality through the microphones was terrible, not kidding. The kids are young enough to be fascinated and not care but it is hard to listen to. After 15 uses or so, one microphone stopped working. That was okay with me as I had started using it as a CD play only, which wasn\\'t so bad. But now even that is skipping constanty for a CD that works perfectly fine elsewhere. I always used it plugged into the wall, so it has never been banged around.

Once my excited kids opened then they looked very much like knock offs. I was skeptical until my 9 year old showed me what they should look like. The quality looked poor, no furry baby (plain poorly colored plastic) paint on all models was clearly inferior to other shopkins the kids showed me.

Also the hole at the back is so large if it is not standing up the fish fall out and if another fish is angled inside the next fish fall out anyway so lots of times no rewarding plonk. My 16 month olds think you put it face down and put the fish in the big mouth at the back, or just chew on the fishes and they struggle to line up the fishes and the slots so maybe it will be of some fine motor benefit.<br />But it looks pretty.\"\\nI purchased 12 of these exact same ESC\\'s from ebay and 5 of the 12 are dead on arrival.......\\nNot as well made as I thought it would be\\nCheap made not sturdy on drone\\nThis is a piece of junk.

Out of the box I immediately lost one of the small foam balls. Not because I dropped it, or something like that, but because I loaded the blaster and fired it once. The power of this blaster is real, and also the ammunition bounces. I have yet to go test it for range, but at short distances the accuracy is insane in comparison to any other nerf blaster I have. As far as I can tell, this will definitely reach advertised ranges.  As for the ammunition, it\\'s very soft and doesn\\'t hurt on impact (point blank shot at foot), but I\\'m unsure about how it would feel on the face, since due to the power of the blaster I\\'m still hesitant to fire it at my cheek (ultimately a necessary test to see if it\\'s safe for HvZ). As such, the ammunition itself is probably one of the best kinds I have ever come across in terms of safety.  Now, while the blaster is VERY powerful, there are reasons I have given it 3 stars instead of 5 stars:  First off, let me just say this is NOT a blaster for smaller kids. At all. Despite being a Nerf product, pulling back and priming the blaster is very difficult and not smooth at all. It takes a significant amount of effort in order to actually prime it. After priming, of course, comes firing the blaster. This. Is. Loud. To put it in terms of how I feel it would perform in a game of HvZ, you would use all your ammo up fending off zombies after firing this blaster ONCE. It is not a gun for stealth, whatsoever.  Despite it being juxtaposed to the other flywheel alternative (which from my understanding is also very loud), this blaster could not be considered a sidearm. It is about as large as blasters come, probably a little less about the size of an EAT, and bigger than the Retaliator. You could not (reasonably) have this weapon in a sidearm holster without hindering your movement. My largest complaint about the design is the fact that the blaster itself is extremely unbalanced, with the back of the blaster much heavier than the front (from the handle forwards) is. Without bracing the back against your arm or something like that, it will feel awkward, and it\\'s a tad too short for me to shoulder it comfortably.  Another thing to note about this gun is that, while it isn\\'t a problem for me, it\\'ll pose more of a problem for people with smaller hands. I have large, spindly hands. Hands that are just barely too big for the extra large latex gloves I wear for labs. With my palm, I\\'m able to release the magazine/clip (i\\'m not sure which one it is) by pushing the button, but I know that it\\'ll be much more difficult to release with smaller hands. If you can release it, the clip/magazine will drop out with only gravity, so you\\'ll have to be careful of accidentally dropping it, but it can also be very helpful for quick reloads.  While a lot of these cons are minimized for me due to my stature, I can see a lot of these design issues presenting problems for people who have shorter arms, smaller hands, and young children. As for anticipated usefullness in HvZ, I don\\'t see myself missing a shot due to blaster failure, or the inherent inaccuracy present in these blasters.  If purchasing for an adult with adequate arm strength and long arms, take this review as if it was a 4.5/5 star blaster, with the balance of the blaster being the only issue.  EDIT 1 (August 10th, 2015): I have to say the blaster started jamming a lot and now has been rendered inoperable, with no jam door available, I can\\'t get the small ball out, and I can\\'t do anything about it. The construction of the blaster has also revealed shoddy worksmanship as an attempt to open up the blaster with a screwdriver revealed that about half of the screws were stripped and I was not able to unscrew them to try to unjam it from the inside. Long story short, I\\'m reducing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star based on how long I have had this gun before it was rendered inoperable.\"\\n\"Squares started popping off almost immediately upon arrival, especially the square covering the screw\"\\nQuality is very poor.

I bought this because why not, well this thing never flew besides the wind picking it up. I did some math and this balloon way too small to float unless your in cold weather with full sun like Big Bear.

Purchased as a fun hand out for our canoe trip. Could hardly squeeze them on my face, they broke the second time I tried.

Very disappointing for our grandson. 😒\\n\"Doesn\\'t fit the standard mat that I bought and the bottom cap broke off when I put a lower quality mat into it. I was forced to super glue the bottom cap onto the tube and works fine. Personally I think it is a good idea to make it prismatic, but please make note that the customer is always right and would spend more money on your product if it was better quality. Falty product. I won\\'t be buying another one.\"\\nBatteries lasted less than 1 minute each.\\nThese look very cheap and are so stiff.\\n\"The truck hasn’t worked properly since opened.  The problems started with the controller handle not communicating properly with the truck’s receiver on reverse mode.  This was followed by battery cable connection having a very loose fit, which causes it to constantly be disconnecting.  This caused the truck to stop running, as expected.  The last issue has come to be the battery failing to charge.  The product doesn’t work at all now!  If you\\'re not planning to open it and work on it yourself, don\\'t buy it.\"\\nnotwerthit\\n\"I was completely disappointed on the item I received. I purchased this to replace a Lelani Hula Doll by KC I had gotten about 3 1/2 yrs ago. After being in the sun all day, every day, she was starting to show some wear (slight fading and the grass skirt coming apart). What I received from &#34;shophawaiishop&#34; wasn\\'t even close to what is pictured or near what my original Lelani doll looks like. In every aspect it is a cheap and dishonest representation !  The skirt came apart immediately. She is bizarrely disfigured along with the artistic details and colors being horrific. The color of the replacement is so far off, it\\'s bizarre. The Lelani that I have had for 3 1/2+ years and sitting in the sun relentlessly still has significantly brighter colors than the (cheap/counterfeit) brand new replacement. The proportions of the new doll are odd as well, her mouth is so small that even if life-size she would only be able to consume food through a straw...... Not to mention, her head looks like it was placed in a vice.<br /><br />  KC Hawaii has been the standard for &#34;dash-board&#34; dolls and I can only imagine this is quite frankly a counterfeit, or that KC Hawaii will no longer exist in the next coupe years.......<br /><br />  Will send back immediately for refund !\"\\nThe Navy anchor is so off center on the front of the coin that that it cheapens the overall look.  As a Navy Veteran I do not carry this coin. I also purchased the Marine Challenge Coin for a friend and it looks great.\\n\"Doll came with broken leg. However, the box appeared to be unopened so it may have just happened naturally by no fault of the seller but still dissapointing for the price. =(\"\\n\"Love the toy and all, but my son used it less than a hand full of times until it started falling apart.\"\\n\"Too small, toddlers don\\'t like sleeping on little beds because they need more space to move.

You do not get eight pokeballs and a Pikachu; just one pokeball (the red one in the center) and a Pikachu.  My son bought this in order to get a Master ball, but it was not included.  Very disappointing.\"\\nMagnet isn\\'t strong enough to really move the balls and divots aren\\'t deep enough to keep the balls in place long enough to create a design. Maybe adults could be successful with a lot of patience but this was absolutely frustrating for our kids.\\n\"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It is a bootleg!  Why?  First off nendoroids\\' origin should NOT be from China; they should always be from Japan.

Please research products before you buy them.  It maybe cute and all, but it\\'s not supporting the companies.  This nendoroid in particular is rare because it\\'s a very old one; same goes with the Ciel one too.  Only use sites such as ami ami or the good smile company\\'s OFFICIAL SITE for rare nendoroids.

Actual dancing motion is a bit naff as well. I\\'d suggest ordering a more expensive version to feel satisfied.\"\\n\"Super disappointed in this toy.  It looked like fun but was defective right out of the box.<br /><br />When we took it out of the box, 9 of the balls were defective and will not stay in the up position.  Since the first thing my child tried to do with it was put all the balls in the up position, this defect is really a big one and ruined the fun for us in minute one.<br /><br />Totally bummed and disappointed about the quality of this toy.\"\\nVery disappointed. Box was tear in the top.\\n\"Do not buy this product!  It is horrible!  The product falls apart and does not stick.  It looks like you can easily send cars down the ramp into the tub but you can\\'t.  There is a plastic piece that prevents it from happening.  When you do release the plastic piece the entire thing falls off the side of the tub.  There are very few toddler bath toys out there, but this is definitely not one of them!  Keep looking elsewhere!  I am very unhappy with my purchase and wish I could have returned it and received a refund.\"\\nI ordered 2 wubble balls with pumps and neither of the pumps worked. So my kids have 2 flat wubble balls. Not a happy customer.\\n\"Comes from overseas, has basic oriental directions, nothing in English, doesn\\'t connect well.\"\\n\"I don\\'t find the music or noise of the toy too loud as other reviewers complained.  There are two volume levels, although the higher setting is needed when the balls pop in order to hear it.  I like that the balls roll out of the dino\\'s mouth, so they don\\'t shoot out fast or go far.  My star-rating is based on the fact that the popping mechanism broke after 3 uses and the toy was already past the return date since I didn\\'t open it right away.  My 7 month-old didn\\'t even get to enjoy the functions of the toy before it stopped working.  Fisher-Price usually makes quality toys that last (I even have some from my childhood 30+ years ago!) but this item unfortunately malfunctioned.

They are tough and durable but take awful pictures unless both the camera and the subject are completely still, which is almost impossible for a four-year-old. And they for some reason come with inane games that my kids (who have limited screen time because of my belief that it is not great for them) are addicted to. After the first day they haven\\'t even been interested in taking pictures, just playing games (which also have annoying music and sound effects).\"\\nBought this at the local Wally world for under five bucks.

Just junk.\\nThis is crazy why would anyone buy a magic Band on here for $40 when you can get it at the park for 20 the batteries are only good for two years so you have no idea how long the battery will last on this thing they have to activate it when the person buys it\\nNOT WORTH IT\\n\"So sorry that I didn\\'t pay more attention to the poor reviews than the good ones. Although my granddaughter received this in March, she only used it on her doll a few times. I am now looking at a shredded bodice and at a loss how to fix it for her American Girl dress-up party tomorrow. No matter how I fix it, the top will be tight and shred again. The other seams on the dress are fine. But the bodice is too form-fitting, which resulted in the shredding. Too late to return, but not too late to caution other buyers.\"\\n\"My eight year old niece played with it for about two weeks. Not a lot of play time because the charge only lasts about 20-30 minutes. That\\'s okay, it gives her a break from it. However, today the leg broke and is just hanging. I will take a look at it tomorrow but if it is not fixable there is nothing I can do. Bought it from Amazon and did not keep the packaging...didn\\'t think I had to. It was a lot of fun until the leg broke.\"\\nThe battery didn\\'t even last 5 minutes. What a waste of money. Really depressing.\\nHonestly - I dont want to rant but since I bought two bottles (one is not enough by far) I have to say it turned NOT out the way I wanted it nor turned it out the way it was described by advertisement. AK has to watch what they are selling since this is now the third product which is not according to advertisment. I only mention the new metallic colour series... I did everything as described and the tracks did not turn black as they should. In other words it was a mess cleaning everything up afterwards. Stay away and use acrylics.

When we opened it, a connector piece for the pole was missing from the set.  We used duct tape to attach the pieces.  The set itself is very cheaply made and does not stand up straight.  The paddles cracked after two days and the ball never swings along the track on the top, but winds around the pole and needs to be unwound manually.  Complete waste of money and a huge disappointment.  Customer service by the manufacturer failed to acknowledge repeated requests for help.\"\\n\"Ido not buy, serious dissapointment for my son.

So which is it? A three or a triangle? The piano keys are even worse, playing four different concepts, some of which have nothing to do with music.

My daughter (7 years old) was able to play with it for about 30 minutes (normal use) before it stopped functioning correctly. I took a look at it and figured out that the arrow shafts are so thin that they will bend under the force of the bow being released. When the arrow shafts bend, they hit the sides of the firing channel (the channel is meant to assist children in loading and firing it at the right angle). No amount of bending the arrows back helps. The arrow shafts are so thin and flimsy that they buckle under the bows own firing force. The toy looks very fun for a young child but it\\'s just made so poorly and is a total POS. If you want a bow and arrow toy for your child, I would suggest the Zing Air Huntress as a great alternative. It is very strong and will last even under heavy use and will shoot long distances.

It\\'s time to leave this game permanently on the shelf and I suggest you do the same.\"\\nSuper disappointed! These should have clearly said they are too heavy too float. Big waste of money! Do not buy!!\\nThis is not worth your money or your child\\'s time.<br />Pretty much the only thing this &#34;toy&#34; does is make sounds from the show and that is it. No lights and no frills.<br />My daughter lost interest before we even got home\\nThis was purchased as a Birthday gift and when my little one ( who\\'s only 48 lbs) was up on the slide it immediately deflated and she fell......it was torn at the seam. I tried to repair it with the kit but will not hold air :(\\nnot worth what it cost does not deal cards good at all\\nTransmitter never worked\\n\"While this Pop is beautiful for sure, she\\'s poorly made... in a matter of days on a shelf, both pony-tails broke off... while it\\'s an easy enough fix with crazy glue, Funko\\'s quality is usually much better than this...\"\\n\"Really cool, except, where the beck is Free!? He is a very important part of the story. There are three unnamed ghouls and no Fred. My daughter would not understand that.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t realize how ridiculously small and pointless these toys were. Not worth the money, unless your kid is a collector.\"\\n\"These balloons did not deliver at all, got them for my daughter\\'s birthday party and only a handful stayed full.  The rest all lost their water as soon as the fell off the attachment.  Will never buy these again. Had to give a star to post, should get negative stars.\"\\n\"Got this pipe in a trade and WOW its horrible. As the other reviews say no back pressure, which doesn\\'t allow the engine to start properly. Its very loud and offers NO performance advantage WHATSOEVER. Just looks cool that\\'s all. Its made from thin aluminum material in the header, the coupler is cheap and melts easily, and it makes the engine run much hotter. Do your homework and get a Traxxas or HPI tuned pipe for what you need it for.\"\\nBags were too small\\nignore all of the 5 star reviews here. I got one of these and it broke after 4 weeks. I sent it back and got another which broke in four weeks.\\n\"This thing is to hev, an the controler not much good , go with the revell model\"\\nI bought this Deadpool plushie for my friend who is obsessed with Deadpool.  I have to say she was extremely disappointed and started making dying animal noises when she received it.  It was about the size of a small water bottle and the paint was already chipping.  The packaging was also distressing as it came in a box twice the size of Deadpool...just think of the environment.  The biggest thing was that it came nearly a month later than indicated...leaving my friend in a state of distress so much so that she now needs therapy!\\nItem worked great at firsthe but after a few uses it stopped working. Didn\\'t have the original packaging so I was unable to return. Not satisfied\\n\"it popped within 2 days on multiple spots in the seam, meaning it is very poorly made. If the seams were not sealed well in making it then its not going to last on any of them. Which is sad because the plastic it was made out of seemed very thick and durable.<br /><br />There were 4 different chambers that needed to be blown up. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TORE AT THE SEAM. Very sad Christmas gift.\"\\nCame with a hole in it. I\\'ve bought these types of pools before and they usually last a couple summers before the plastic gets too brittle and the side cracks. This one though cam already brittle and old. Shame cause I like these better than the inflatable kinds that all the stores seem to have. Guess I\\'m switching to store bought inflatables though because I don\\'t want to take a chance with another one having a hole. Filling this up to discover a whole and then having to dry it out and roll it back up to ship it back was a huge pain.\\nIt tore the first day.\\nThe bag is bigger than expected and the colour of the bag is not the same (not as bright) as what I view online\\nI bought a previous Thomas Kinkade Disney 4 500 piece puzzle set. Each puzzle comes in its own separate bag inside the box. I open this box and there are only three puzzles in it. It is missing a puzzle.\\n\"Arrived on time.  Other than that save your money, very flimsy. Spend the extra and buy green one .\"\\n\"Does not sprinkle as shown in the picture, garbage!\"\\n\"My Bright Beats Dance and Move BeatBo came without the ability to dance. It simply does not move at all like everyone else’s.<br />I have tried changing the batteries with a new set of alkaline one´s. No movement neither.<br />It is a beautiful toy and if you’re lucky enough to receive one fully working I really think your kid will love it.<br />I did call Fisher-Price to see if we were doing something wrong, but they tell us the item was defective and the does not have a replacement, so they will give us a Fisher Price coupon for the cost of the toy after they have received the damaged one. Thankfully I did buy this toy at Amazon because they are pleased to serve their clients, they will give me a refund with no questions asked, and that´s why I will always be their costumer.\"\\n\"bought twice, used each one once and returned both times because it leaks!  Even tried hatch tape on the second one and still leaked!\"\\n\"Really cheap product. We had to nearly break it open to get the Giftcard out because the latch did not open as it should have. A fun way to present a gift, but not worth it.\"\\nGot my first one play with it 5min and the gears got mess up. So I return it and got other one. The second truck never run. The battery won\\'t charge.\\nKNOCK OFF from CHINA !!! do not buy this Elsa Doll\\n\"Terrible! They arrived on time, and are smaller than expected! I knew they were small, but these are outrageous! The paint is horrid! Axew isn\\'t even the color! Don\\'t waste money!\"\\nIt\\'s not what I expected.  My son doesn\\'t use it.\\n\"Just got Baymax today and was I disappointed!<br />I am a pop vinyl collector and had purchased this to add with my other Baymax. When I received mine it was 100% FAKE!<br />The plastic felt cheap and squishy, the box was beaten up and not even a Funko box, the line across his eyes was missing and there is no Disney or Funko trademarks on his feet (WTF)<br />I am super disappointed and hopefully will get my money back.<br />FYI don\\'t buy from the sellers from China, it will be 100% fake.\"\\nI have 555 balloons and no refill inserter to put them on the plastic!!!

Shoots 10% of the time.shoots 3 feet when it does shoot\\n\"These bubbles blow! Except not actually, because that implies that you can make actual bubbles when you blow into the wand. They\\'re called &#34;Miracle&#34; because it will actually be a miracle if you manage to make a bubble with this terrible watered down solution.

Very small even smaller than I expected.  Used as a giveaway.  Would not recommended this product.  It is disappointing.  Would not recommended for little kids.\"\\nVery cheaply made and did not last. Some came apart.\\n\"These are really small, and very poor quality.  The paint smears.  I would not allow my kids to touch these.  I am not sure what is in the paint, and the paint rub off.  After I received the item, I re-check Amazon feed back again.  Notice how many recent low rating.  I didn\\'t see these low rating when i put in the order.  I an not sure how that many low rating equates to 3.6 star.  I am beginning to suspect Amazon is doing fuzzy math to calculate product review stars.\"\\nSteering wheel on radio does not steel the truck.\\nDO NOT BYE THIS DOLL. it does not come with a hat of a panda on the outfit\\n\"Both the guitar and amp were microscopic in size and did not appear to be good quality.  Not at all as it appeared in pictures.  Had to pay for my own shipping and because it was in the middle of nowhere, it cost almost as much as the guitar.  Only good thing is that they did give me a refund.\"\\nBricks were much smaller than pictured\\nNo accessories.  Not the doll pictured.  Very disappointing as it was for my daughters birthday this weekend.\\ndont go by pics. these are way too small\\n\"I received one tray only. according to the title, what I received is not what is advertised.

I purchase them for my twins boys and my nieces and nephews.  Unfortunately on this toy one of the yellow pieces that are kind of like a teeter totter on the bottom was installed upside down.  I didn\\'t realize this until it was too late to return through Amazon.

However, I need the brake mechanism due to the incline in my yard. It did not turn up with the rest of the kit and has still not turned up. The kids are in danger of getting whiplash from the brake that I set up. If you are thinking of buying this kit, you should purchase it elsewhere without the brake since it is substantially cheaper.\"\\nClasp will not stay closed and watch stopped working after 2 months.\\n\"Terrible.  I initially received this as a gift for my daughter last Christmas. Upon opening and using it it immediately broke.  Anytime I tried to sew 2 pieces of the sew cool fabrics that i got together it would get stuck and the light would blink.<br />I emailed sew cool and did not receive a response until 3 months later when I already threw it out.  My daughter has been asking continuously for a new one so i finally bought one from amazon and received it 3 days ago. I had hoped my previous one was just defective.<br /><br />Unfortunately NO, upon opening the box and trying to sew the sew cool fabrics, it kept getting stuck and stopping. It appears that the machine cannot handle the thickness of its own fabrics.  My daughter is so into the sewing that she is literally just taking a piece of there fabric and running it through the machine without adding cotton or the other sides...Just so she could &#34;sew&#34;.<br /><br />Terrible product, would not recommend.\"\\nBalloons leaked and we lost all the balloons.

They may be Ninja warriors or something but they are not from Ninjago.  They are not the true Ninjago characters as their outfits, helmets, etc are all different.  We bought the Ninjago Character Encyclopedia for him and they are not listed/shown in there anywhere.  If you child wants a Ninja these would be fine.  A true Ninjago character...I would not recommend.\"\\n\"The tent that I received has only two sides! Very, very different from what is represented in the picture. I was disappointed but kept it because my two-year-old grandson was here when it came and I let him open it, not knowing it was going to turn out to be half a tent. I am usually pleased with my Amazon.com purchases; not this time.\"\\n\"If you read the listing, it does NOT say the bag is fire proof. It will not contain a fire it will make it worse. a LI-PO fire is very hot and most of this bag is made from plastic, just take a lighter to it inside or out, these things are more dangers than just charging your Li-Po in open air. I got this blue cell bag.

This book ignores the Tv series (let alone the follow-on animation directly related to this product such as The Sentinels and Robotech: Love, Live, Alive) but also the canon comics such as Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles. Next to nothing in this book makes sense.<br />- The kludged together REF &#34;Destroids&#34; that use a mish-mash of parts from the Ajax, Spartas, Alpha and Beta Veritechs.<br />- The timeline as presented in the beginning of the book makes no sense as it leaves the Expeditionary Force sitting on their thumbs for fifteen years doing nothing while the Regess dominates the Earth, long after the REF killed The Invid Regent.<br />- The REF has intimate knowledge of both The Masters and The Invid, but none of the characters from the REF who return during The Second Robotech War bother to warn or inform any of the members of the United Earth Forces of these facts.<br />- An entire class of ships that are, according to the Tv series, at least 15 years old (and are even mentioned as being part of the REF mission when it left in 2022 in a previous RPG sourcebook) is now a single unique prototype. This despite the fact that the first ship of this entire class of battleships is shown in Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what good there is in this book is severely outweighed by the pile of refuse that makes up the rest of the book. Palladium Books needs to consider another author for any future supplements.\"\\nSO hard to get the man into the base!  My husband and I have both struggled with it to no avail.

Yet.  how? My son is 4yrs old. He felt it was a rip, but wouldn\\'t let me send it back. Kids????? Update. Now I can post picks. As you can see its tiny and also I\\'m missing the shield that completes the vehicle transformation. I have it next to &#34;Rachet&#34;  and Rachet is much larger, better detailed and about $10 or 15 from target.\"\\nDidn\\'t work!\\nOnly worked for a couple of weeks at which time I returned item\\n\"These were just regular earth toned crayons. I don\\'t know what I was expecting, but this wasn\\'t it. There\\'s really no point to purchasing this if you already have the 48 crayon set.\"\\nI was very disappointed in this product! Only one Mylar ballon came :(\\nThey are pretty and colorful. That\\'s about it! Won\\'t float upright. I bought them to play pick up ducks from water. A game for toddlers. Failure. They drew them from a bag instead to get a winner.\\nDo not buy this. Horrible quality.\\n\"I got it for my kid, it spoiled him some how. Instead of being good he\\'s just Darude.\"\\nNot what\\'s shown in the picture. I was very disappointed in the item. It\\'s missing the little stackable part and doesn\\'t have all the pieces that fit into EVERY hole... Just a few. There\\'s a circle piece that doesn\\'t fit into any of the other shapes. There was also a trash piece. Won\\'t purchase from you again.\\nWeird Legs. She cannot stand on her own. The hair prevents this. She has unusually long legs that do not close. Very limited articulation. Beautiful colors but a stiff and skinny Superhero. I would not recommend.\\nIt is so small it is ridiculous!\\nWay to small for what I was looking for.\\nI was torn when it arrived and the head rest would not stay on so I returned it for another brand and style.\\nTea set arrived broken!\\nI ordered this and got a solid black chair.\\n\"It was a tiny, disappointing, piece of junk.  I ordered 10 and many arrived already cracked.  Way smaller then I expected.  I returned them all.\"\\n\"Purchased from Hobby People does not work , it powers up but provides intermittewnt power to the receiver and will not power the motor , tested a differnet esc and it works fine\"\\nI also bought the pirate set too and those puppets tiny as well. I kept sets but definitely not worth the price.\\n\"The eggs are sturdy, I was excited to open them and see the different dinosaurs that the kids would be seeing, unfortunately they were all the same long neck dinosaur minus one T. rex.  I will definitely be returning them.\"\\n\"It simply didn\\'t work. I replaced the batteries, double-checked to make sure I had the batteries in correctly. Still didn\\'t work. Very disappointing. It was for my grandson.\"\\nIt stopped working after two days!\\nThese a absolutely inferior. They are without a doubt the worst juggling balls I have ever come across. So sad.\\n\"The charger only works when angular pressure is applied to the DC in, would not recommend.\"\\nDid not fly property<br />dangerous if windy\\nDid not work once I got them\\n\"Yah, these are junk. I had to perform open chicken surgery after the first shot. Silly rubber band came unhooked and head flew off. It takes opening the poor guy\\'s chest cavity to fix, then it wouldn\\'t stay fixed. Fun noise, poopy toy. We got a frog and have had multiple monkeys that were all good, maybe gawd hates chickens?\"\\nI bought these thinking I was getting a good deal. Totally wrong. I basically threw away 10 dollars. You can get the exact same type of balls 100 count for 5 bux at Walmart.\\n\"When I installed and used on my X8C, they moved up and down on the motor shaft as if they were not thick enough. Also they made a terrible racket obviously as the blades would move up and down on the shaft based on the power being applied to the motor. All fittings used were stock. Wont purchase again.\"\\n\"Not happy at all.......  It took forever to get here & then the product is nothing like what Costco has I thought it would be the same, but this raft does not hold me up and I only weight 140lbs.. It does not stay flat like the picture.\"\\nDoes not work on my DVD player\\nThe air nozzles pop out and open up on their own so it won\\'t hold air and it doesn\\'t stay upright in the pool...just falls over :(\\n\"It did not fly like stated in description, It also was made very poorly and cheaply made. The wings broke off even though we were gentle with toy. What a DISSAPOINTMENT for my sons 9th birthday!!!!!!!! Not worth the money.\"\\n\"When I open the box and assembled it I noticed that this product had 2 missing pieces. The box was sealed and the pieces inside a plastic bag, so it was not something that happened while shipping. The manufacturer created a faulty product. On top of that the print is really bad  Look at Elsa\\'s forehead it is scratched\"\\n\"Suction cups do not work. Seller gives a lengthy explanation of cleaning process but after six months of cleaning and having the basket fall, I give up. This is not like any suction cup I have ever worked with. Seems like there isn\\'t enough depth in the cups to make them hold up.\"\\nthis car is cheap i have been to the rc shop a lot because it runs bad and when i get down to half a tank the car cuts out and i have to wait a while  to start back up\\n\"Dull, scuffed lenses, uneven pupils... Crap stuff.\"\\n\"This item came used, the box was torn up, poorly made product.\"\\n\"Not meant for a car even though it says it in the title, which is why I bought it.<br />It is a paper sticker on a magnet backing, it will peel as soon as it sees a little rain.\"\\n\"Really fascinating game (the Wikipedia entry for it is fascinating as well). I loved the game.<br />Unfortunately, the quality of these cards is terrible. The cheap paper was coated with some product to give it a glossy appearance, but whatever they used to coat the cards causes them to stick to each other. This makes dealing or arranging your hand very difficult.\"\\n\"Would rate this book as half a start if that were possible... even a negative star...<br /><br />pros: The book is a good thickness, a nice page count, some of the art for the new races is good, some is okay...<br /><br />CONS: Palladium dropped the ball on this one really bad...<br />- Continuity: zero effort was put into checking the product for continuity errors- They list people dying 14 years before they did in the canon timeline.<br />-  Editing: next to zero effort was place into proofreading and error checking, Johnathan Wolfe\\'s name is misspelled in many places, even alternating between the correct spelling and the wrong spelling on a single page. multiple contradictions exist within several pages.<br /> - Art: The art for the previously detailed Sentinels Destroids and Battlepods was heavily altered, to look like a kit-bash of random mecha parts (mostly Alpha arms and ajax heads) stuck together with a hot-glue gun. Chuck Walton is a great artist, but these things belong in a rifts book, not a Robotech one.\"\\nIt didn\\'t work. The materials were kind of cheap as well. Quick refund from Amazon\\nBopper not Boppers.\\nPiece broke the first week My son played with it. Thelittle magnet pieces fell out. That\\'s a huge child hazard.\\nIt\\'s too small and can\\'t be maneuvered using the handle.travels only in straight line.what\\'s worse is its such a pain to disassemble that I couldn\\'t return it.\\nI ordered it and could not return it for the one with the proper connector. sure it works great but will not know.\\n\"So disappointed it looks nothing like the one in the picture don\\'t waist your money, it looks like it was undone there was string coming out of it .\"\\nThese broke apart after the very first use in the pool\\n\"pure junk . lasted 3 days, does not even turn left ! total waste of money, stay away from this garbage.\"\\nBut for my 5 year old on his birthday took us about an hour to assemble and the second he went to go pick it up and move it to his little toddler table it fell apart in his hands so then we decided to super glue it all together because that\\'s what he wanted was it to be altogether not that he could take it apart and we did so and unfortunately he accidentally dropped it and because he dropped it a couple of the blocks snapped because the plastic is then on the blocks just feel like it was a waste of money he was so bummed he had a total of eight days before it was just garbage.\\n\"The doll did not have any of the accessories (no cape or bow and arrow), it looks like the cheaper version of this doll. Very disappointed.\"\\nNot worth it. Kids could hardly slide on it.\\nThey were all the same Shopkin. Thought it was odd\\nToo big and the smell is overwhelming\\n\"They seemed cute, received as a gift. First they wouldn\\'t both light up. Now I can\\'t get them to stop lighting up. They are sitting in a toy box going off nonstop. I am hoping the batteries die soon.\"\\nThey were not bey Blake\\'s they were a knock off and not very good\\nI am so disappointed. These are not Original Shopkins. My daughter has been watching online to differentiate the fake from the real and after all the wait and anticipation.\\nTook a month to get delivered and our son barely ever played with them.\\nVery poor quality. Arrived broken and broke even more with minimal play.\\nProduct not what was needed and also not so good. Didnt use much after first use. Daughter got very bored pretty fast. Amazon was great with refund. Amazon also let me keep product anyway!\\nit is too easy to twist it out of shape and it does not go back into the coil position.\\nThe paper on this pad is NOT heavyweight as advertised.  It is actually thinner than the computer paper I use in my printer.  Very disappointed in this product.\\n\"Extremely loud, won\\'t work properly. Seems to be fake, wasn\\'t given a refund or even a reply.\"\\nBroke when it got here and doesn\\'t fly.\\nWe used this pool for 3 days before it developed a leak. It looks like the liner is pulling away from the bottom ring causing the ring to deflate. The leak is much too large to try and repair. I recommend buying an Intex pool instead of this piece of junk.\\nCheap phone.  Not a touch screen.  Hard to understand the accent of the voice that talks.  Not worth $8.\\nMore than half of these products did not work\\n\"Sorry to say, that after buying (2) of the exact same puzzle, One from a craft store, and one from the on-line company.  This is a very inferior product.  Both times either pieces were missing OR if you can believe this, I actually had 2 of the same pieces within the puzzle. I wanted this to be a picture on my wall, so it was worth it to me to try to buy a second puzzle.  The time, effort, and money makes me very sad.\"\\n\"I\\'m so furious!!! I bought this battery, plugged it in and I ruined my quad. The battery had something wrong with it and now my whole quad is trashed! DONT BUY!!!!!\"\\nThese are total crap. Three of them were missing lenses.\\nProduct over priced.  Described as 5x7.  This is the size of the card the car comes attached to.  Found similar item from toys r us for 6.99.  I had paid $23.00 for this one.  Will be returning the item.\\nThe stickers were not put on well.  They had such big bubbles that it ruined the effect of the smooth metallic surface.  I returned it.\\nLooks alot bigger.... its very very small my 1 year old got stuck in it very disappointed....\\nLiked the lamp but thought I was ordering a taupe lamp and instead it turned out to be grey and I have nothing in my home grey.  So I returned it regretfully.  Loved it otherwise.\\nPoor quality - returned\\n\"Seem split after 3 days of use. Tried to patch, virtually impossible to fix. Hopefully Amazon will stand behind this product, because the reviews suggest the manufacturer will not.\"\\nTook one charge and swelled up. Junk\\nSome came open and spilling the beans already.\\n\"The item was 3&#34; wide. The picture made it look a lot larger, and with the price I expected it to be a normal size stuffed animal not a key chain size.\"\\n\"First one arrived in pieces.  Replacement arrived in one piece, but is impossible to clean.  No matter how many times it is washed, you can see coffee stained water seeping out from under the shark.\"\\n\"granddaughter loved it, however it fell apart before the first game was complete..so BOOOOO. She  was so disappointed\"\\n\"To add a 3.75-inch Ant-Man to my collection, this $20 rip-off was my only option. I have no interest in the big ant; I didn\\'t even take it out of the package. I did notice that it doesn\\'t have the harness that Antony has in the movie. Everyone is complaining that their ant\\'s legs fall off. Well, my Ant-Man\\'s right leg falls off. I can pop it back on, but it is so loose it falls off again if you try to hold him by that leg. I wasted a lot of time and effort to return it for an exchange, only to have the same issue. So, $20 for a figure with a defective design.\"\\nSo not worth the price. Wheels don\\'t even move!\\nThese are small & thin and rip easily. They were packaged well but some tiles were dirty. As if a car tire drove over it. Waste of money.\\nThis thing broke within the first 10 seconds of flight.  Cheaply built.\\n\"We had to replace the one we bought at Kohl\\'s. This is NOT what Kohl\\'s was selling! The tag says Kohl\\'s but the weight is different and it seems smaller. We can be wrong, let\\'s see if the grandchild knows.\"\\n\"Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a nice figure, but I had ordered a Deathclaw figure.\"\\nCouldn\\'t hear out of them and they wouldn\\'t stay in het tablet\\n\"Just opened the box and right away noticed that the product length seemed much shorter than 24&#34;. Measured it and sure enough they were only 14&#34; long. So one star for inaccurate information, or did receive the wrong product? The anchors do look and feel good quality though.  Planning to return it.\"\\n\"This was a pain to put together. The doors fit too tight, the screws are about an inch longer than they need to be, the set up is not fun. The noise maker just screws in and doesn\\'t even blend in with the oven top.  My child who LOVES play kitchens, will play with this for all of 2 minutes before just walking off to play with the plastic plates or pizza pieces it came with. I really wish I would have opted for another play kitchen.  Maybe even a different model of Little Tikes.  I always buy Little Tikes items, and this is the first that I have to say... I hate. :(\"\\nThe updated version is terrible. Way too easy for kids...holes are larger. Buy the original version!!\\none of the six broke right out of the box not the most durable water toy. Honestly the dollar store version was just as good and 1/3 the price.\\nWouldn\\'t stay inflated\\nHit or miss whether it works.  Remote is awful but toy is cute.  Just don\\'t expect it to follow you or do any tricks.\\n\"This item was properly packaged, and arrived on schedule.  My complaint is about the design - the bucket comes unattached to the operating handle so that it would fit in a smaller box.  The user slides the handle into place behind the bucket.  The two attachment points are so poorly designed that they come out as soon as the bucket is used.  This makes the loader useless.  I am very disappointed in Tonka.\"\\n\"Overlooked the fact they were polyester. Cotton bandanas are the best for my needs. My mistake, not the product. I get the one star!\"\\npolyester material makes hard to wear more than 10 min.<br />My boy complains its too hot\\n\"I would not recommend this product! A large portion of the balloons leaked from the top closing as soon as they were filled up. Only a few out of the 2 boxes we used actually popped when thrown at someone, they just bounced off.\"\\nNot easy to use for a 6 year old as far as decorating.  Not worth the money.\\nPuzzle does not contain 1000 pieces as described. This is only a 500 piece puzzle. Also the actual puzzle size is 20 x 20 inches.\\n\"Item was described as &#34;Very Good Condition&#34;. Let\\'s see... all scratched, stickers faded, missing parts and small other detail... simply not working even after trying multiple fresh batteries... oh boy.. would love to see what would be an item described as &#34;poor condition&#34; then....\"\\nThis doll is really ugly! When it is out of its cheap pjs and hat (as most dolls end up) it looks like an alien that needed a little more time in the womb. It has purple skin and its body is permanently curved so it looks like it has a hump back/neck. It was the perfect size for my toddler and I liked that it was anatomically correct but I couldn\\'t stand to look at it. Also it\\'s &#34;parts&#34; are itsy-bitsy.\\nIt wasn\\'t the thing that I wanted bc of the name\\nthese are like little crumbs i expected them to be bigger.\\nthese were misrepresennted.  The ad read that they were 2&#34;x2&#34;x1&#34; approximately and when we received them they were 4&#34;x4&#34; Not what we wanted at all.\\nLow quality cubes.  I returned them.  Pay a little more and buy them individually for a better experience.\\nThe rope is good but the handler came off the first day my granddaughter use it\\nIt was broke when I received IT!!!\\n\"Stickers are stickers, there usually isn\\'t much to say. Unfortunately not a single sticker lined up with the cut out, so we had a ton of stickers with a body and no head or a head and no body. Other than them ending up being a complete waste of money and a disappointment to my four year old, they were cute before being peeled.\"\\nDo not waste your money on this product. It is extremely cheap made. I bought it as a birthday gift for my 3 years old and he could not enjoy it for a minute. It broke while trying to install the tracks and the wagons lose their wheels.\\nBottom split after an hour of play and top split within the next half hour.  Wouldn\\'t recommend this to anyone.\\n\"Extremely disappointed. It looks like a 5 year old painted these. Some parts have so much paint in one area, others are half painted. Some have black eyes. Some are painted all over the place\"\\n\"The item was not clean and did not work! We were expecting a brand new LED jump rope but when it arrived it was extremely dirty up near the handles. Pulled out the tab to let the battery make connection and it didn\\'t work. Bought brand new batteries to see if it just came with dead batteries but those didn\\'t work on the jump rope either. I would NOT suggest to anyone to buy from this store. I paid $6 plus about the same for shipping, the item never worked, it was filthy, and to top it all off they don\\'t accept returns. I feel like I just got scammed.\"\\n\"Girls loved but kinda junky imo, lol\"\\nTwo right hand bruh\\n\"Bought 4 of them as gifts and none of them actually produced :(<br />Had it been just one or two, I would have thought perhaps user error.....but definitely not four!!!\"\\nI just don\\'t get it.  The purpose of this thing is not very apparent to me. It\\'s so tiny and the games they say to play with it are lame and don\\'t even need this to play. There are simple homemade alternatives.\\nThe volume on the larger owl is  hardly laudible. My grandchild was terribly disappointed! !!\\nThe worst puzzle I have ever bought from Ceaco! Pieces are thinner than normal and were coming apart. I had to glue many before I could use them. Glue seemed to be splattered on the top of pieces. On a humid day the pieces started to warp! I won\\'t trust this company as I once did.\\nThe kite &#34;stakes&#34; did not fit well together and we had to tape them to hold them in place.  Within 15 minutes of flying the kite the stakes broke and we had nothing..  Terrible experience\\nSmall and parts wont stay together\\n\"The wheels barely turn and the trucks are made of heavy plastic molded to the board making turning nearly impossible.  It has nice Ninja Turtle graphics, but as a skateboard it fails utterly.\"\\nDelivered with a hole in the arm and was unable to be blown up.\\nPaint rubbed off all over me was horrible to get it off and it would not stay inflated even 1 hour.  I had to rent a tube. Family vacation ruined!!!!\\nThe pieces are really small.\\nI only recieved 6 boxes if crayons. It said a whole sale box of 48 boxes. Im VERY DISAPPOINTED! I\\'m on a budget and didn\\'t get what was advertised or what I thought I was buying. Now I hav to return wait for a refund then start all looking all over.\\n\"I received this item in return for my review. I was excited to give it a go, BUT I was looking at the description.. Soft. I am a Child Passenger Safety Technician Instructor. I help parents learn how to use car seats and booster seats correctly to help transport their children safely in a vehicle until such a time that they fit the adult seatbelt. We discourage the use of any additional products in the car, from dangling toys to mirrors and secondary video screens. The general rule is not to use anything you wouldn\\'t hit your child with because it can come loose and do just that in a crash, with crash forces applied. I normally test products by whacking my husband with it when he\\'s not expecting it. I must have reason to believe it could be safe before doing such. Hitting him with this would\\'ve been assault.\"\\nTerrible product. Broke the retainer and the spring broke out after 3 starts.\\nSo messed up.\\n\"i would give no stars if i could. This product came broken, did not match the dimensions given, The beads did not match the picture (so much so that they couldn\\'t fit inside the game to close it). It wasn\\'t varnished like it is in the picture either. They promptly refunded it without and a return and i chucked it in the trash\"\\n\"I bought this for my daughter.  She loved it; it looked just as pictured.  Unfortunately, the zipper broke within 1 day of use (and that use was just prepping it for future school use).  If it was worth the bother, I would request a refund or replacement.\"\\nMy ants died the next day😫\\nThe shoes came apart at the soles in the first week. I have had to glue the bottoms of the shoes twice now. I could not return shoes because they have a no return on this shoe. I don\\'t feel anyone should buy theses shoes.\\nSmells terrible.  Cheap print.. probably not licensed.\\nHorrible!!! Looked nothing like the picture and ridiculously small.\\nToo small.\\n\"Very disappointed with the mermaids! They are so small, you could fit all of them in a ziplock snack baggie. Price should be about $10.\"\\n\"I bought this as a gag gift, I would never endorse Joel Osteen\\'s theology or silly ideas of positive affirmations. The game is ridiculously dumb, but was just right for a good belly laugh as we read the instructions and tried to play.\"\\n\"was not foam, contained tons of small pieces.  Children were not able to do this activity without assistance.  Very frustrating for them.\"\\ndid not fit quadcopter it was recommended for\\nDoes not nearly make high enough sprinkles! Very dissapointing!\\n\"Very poor quality, puzzles don\\'t stay together, easily comes off and they are some pieces meesing.

These stars and moon don\\'t glow at all.  They are not cool\\nIt said comes with cards and it only had 1 card. And dead batteries. Not worth hastle of ordering. Unhappy birthday girl.\\nQuick and boring version of monopoly. Might be great for kids.\\n\"What should have been easy assembly turned into a fiasco.  It comes with two hose connectors, but only one is needed.  However, one wouldn\\'t know that, as they have the two connected together in the package.  My fiance sat outside trying to force them together with channel locks until we realized that we only needed one of them.  By that time, he practically had the two fused together and had to force them back apart.  Luckily, the one we needed wasn\\'t ruined.  After finally getting everything inflated and together, the kids had their fun.... That is, until the inflatable pad popped within about 30 minutes, and it was NOT over or under inflated.  I remember my original slip-n-slide back in the day lasting several summers.  This is a joke.\"\\nVery cheaply made.\\ndidn\\'t work at all upon arrival and was not able to return. i\\'ve reached out to company but haven\\'t heard back. $90 for a birthday gift down the drain.\\n\"If I could leave zero stars I would. The product is something you would buy at a Dollar Tree and expect it to break before even getting home, it was non playable, I sent it back the second I got it. How someone could think this product is worth 15 bucks is incomprehensible. I spent an extra 5 dollars and bought a First Act guitar with Disney\\'s Planes on it, I highly recommend purchasing it instead.\"\\nThis in no way looks like gum.  They are candies.  Unable to return because shipping is a much as product.  Would not order again.\\nDon\\'t waste your time buying this! I bought one for my daughter for christmas. The first time she played with it...it popped! She also got another one as a gift from someone else and it popped rt away!\\nDidn\\'t work. Charged it and it lasted 5 minutes. Charged again and it lasted 5 minutes.\\nTERRIBLE!!! WASTE OF MONEY!! FAKE IMAGE!!! NOT THE REAL BALL!!!\\nTo much paid for this small of an item\\nIt didn\\'t even work. It was broken.\\nI bought this for my daughter\\'s birthday cake.  The figures came with paint chipping off.  The picture shows the figures able to fit on the cake stands.  I\\'m not sure how they got this picture because none of the figures will fit or stay in place.  They are all top heavy and fall over (except red one).  They are falsely advertised.  I will definitely be returning this product.\\nDoesn\\'t show up very well on a tinted car window.  I bought this to write &#34;just married&#34; on a friend\\'s car and it barely shows up.\\nHard for kids to use\\nSizing was awful<br /> Did not fit right at all.\\n\"They filled, they came off, and than all the water leaked out of 75% of them.

We have 3 small kids that played in it for 3 days and then I noticed air coming out of multiple seams.  I am not sure if the air is supposed to be leaking out or not.  The house stays inflated, but the air leak is concerning.  One of the leaks near the end of the slide makes a gentle whistling noise.<br /><br />The house fits nicely in our large family room. Our kids are 9, 3, and 2.  The oldest only weighs 65 pounds. The 2 youngest really enjoyed it. I\\'m not sure how any of them could have caused multiple air leaks thru normal bouncing and sliding.  Maybe I just got a defective product?<br /><br />I think this would be a 5 star product if it wasnt for the leaks.\"\\n\"This prop protector is not flexible, so when you crash it doesn\\'t flex like it should and the protector fractures and or pieces break off. I managed to keep mine together with superglue until there wasn\\'t  enough material to glue it back together. :(\"\\nit was brokeing couldnt run it at all\\n\"Avoid!  ASSEMBLY Assembly from pics was sometimes hard to interpret into reality.  Assembly of the powertrain chain was a drag.  OPERATION Getting the little car to complete the circuit was VERY tricky.  Get this - you have to get the bend in in the track just right or it won\\'t work.  If the bend is too sharp, there isn\\'t enough momentum conserved in the car and it won\\'t pass the next corner.  Also, many of the track stabilizer bits COME OFF after small vibrations (such as the passing of a small car on the track); the effect is that the car won\\'t make it around the next time because now the bend in the track is a little bit off.  Finally, my son got so in-tears frustrated he trashed the whole thing into bits (he\\'s never done that before with a regular-sized k\\'nex or LEGO).  So, please do not buy this if you value your own sanity.  However, if you want to teach your children about dealing with real life challenges such as dealing with multiple reappearing annoying problems and tedious tasks, this is for you (not me).\"\\n\"Bought this at GenCon 2015.  Seemed like a neat idea.  Got it home and low-and-behold, the website domain to download the app is gone and these dice are worthless.\"\\n\"Waste of money - I got these at Wal-Mart on sale for only $9.98, still not worth the money. The balloons were small when they fell off the sticks (the biggest being the size of a golf ball); approximately 10 of them didn\\'t fill at all; they all started immediately losing water and were too small to even break when thrown, no matter how hard, they just bounced. They were more like small projectiles. They did fill up fast but were completely worthless.\"\\n\"I was very disappointed and was unable to use the boas.  The  &#34;coral splash&#34; boas turned out to be &#34;pink&#34;!!!  I am an event planner and the boas did not match any of my other CORAL decorations.  It was hectic to have had to scramble to find something else to coordinate, on short notice.  It was stress that I definitely did not need want or need.\"\\nOne of the motor stopped working after first week play with it.\\nthis s*** is real don\\'t buy this its a gate way to hell wat ever u do don\\'t burn it Barry it nowwwwwwww..\\nThe sizing is way off. I would say this fits like a 7/8.  The tail is not a hard tail.  It is very floppy.  I ended up ripping the foam tail  out. It has not held up well too!!!  I should have just order the mermaid fun fin tail.\\nBroke immediately\\ntotal waste of time and $. Took forever to figure out the best way to get the tattoos to work (the instructions were worthless) And still only the solid stencils like a crab turned out ok.

I\\'d like to get a refund!\"\\n\"When I went to have these filled, 2 out of the 3 had holes in them!  I was unable to use them for my son\\'s 1st birthday party.\"\\nThis was an extremely upsetting buy! We followed the directions but...More than half of the balloons deflated in the water before the balloon fight even started. It was my son\\'s birthday party and they were very upset as the balloon fight was the main event.

Hence the reason why I went with this package vs others. I only received ONE. And the one I did get shorts out the second you hit throttle. It would cost me more money to return than just purchase somewhere else. False advertising and defective battery = 1 star for me.\\n\"bussetoy  ruined my favorite jaeger in the movie. this figure had a poor paint job rubbery joint and a weirdly shaped head on the back of the packaging it showed the hand opened mine had fists. there is no ab crunch my figures head does not move there is no detail on the top of the head the color on the figure was bland, there was no weathering effect on it. I was very disappointed for how this figure turned out\"\\nDisappointed ... Sonics shoe  buckles were both off and his back wasn\\'t sewn all the way...\\nI regret buying anything from amazon my toy for my son was delivered with out a input piece for the charger as well as it doesn\\'t work it just blares out the same sound constantly\\nnot to cute and made cheap.\\nthis is really bad donet by is\\n\"I\\'ve made a big mistake getting this. NO foils,rares, OR EVEN UNCOMMONS. JUST commons. There\\'s also lots of duplication\\'s as well as 1 basic land, 1 token card and 3 Japanese cards. If you need to build up your collection just pay a little extra and get the &#34;1000 Assorted Magic: The Gathering Cards Gold Collection&#34; instead. I got that one before and it was at least worth buying.\"\\nDoesn´t work properly. Cheap finished.\\nSlinky lights never worked. Threw the slinky away. I would give zero stars if that were an option. Not the first time I\\'ve bought something from Amazon that didn\\'t work or was missing parts.\\nI purchased this item alone with a gale and only got the blackwing gale and no Solem warning\\n\"Terrible toy, thought it would have great given the reviews!\"\\nThis thing sucks. It does work but it doesn\\'t follow standard dimensions and tooth count. Had to order replacement because it didn\\'t fit my Senior Project design. No active website or reference/support from this company. Do Not Buy!!\\n\"Ordered this product and one whole side was missing the holes so I had to use wood glue and nails to keep it together plus one of the silver handles was cracked. Would have returned it but my girls were watching me put it together and they would have been so disappointed. Instead Im disappointed I kept this item and did not return it, it looks like an old piece of junk and its brand new. I did not try to contact the company so they did not have a chance to rectify the situation.\"\\nNot very happy a present for my grandson and was rip l had to stich it\\nIt will not even go through short grass and the range is horrible\\n\"Like the other reviewers, we bought this train at the gift shop in a zoo. It is a total piece of junk. The flimsy plastic track doesn\\'t stay connected and I\\'m sure, won\\'t last long. The trains barely stay coupled with the slightest bump derailing the whole thing. Even my 3 1/2 year old train enthusiast said it wasn\\'t a very good train after playing with it for about 15 minutes.\"\\n\"Ship from China, take weeks to arrive. All of ours were defective. The rubber bands that seal the balloons were too loose. As soon as they disconnect from the straw the water leaks out the top faster than 5 kids can grab them out of the bucket. Disappointed.\"\\n\"Fun to own, terrible to use\"\\nIt fell apart right out of the box.\\nThis did not work correctly since we have had it.  We have replaced batteries twice hoping that it would work properly with no luck.\\nThere was no winner it was a disappointing and embarssaing at the bridal shower.\\nThese were what I was looking for but they are really a one-time-use as they leak once opened.\\nBroke within 20 minutes of playing with it\\nThese work about 1/2 of the time :(\\nMarkers were dried out\\nto small and don´t look great\\nThese letters came to me folded in half which ruined them and made tgem unusable.\\nGot the package today....so disappointed the box  was open and not even any plastic protection inside the box...go figure out it was so dirty and looks so old and used with all tjose dirt attached to it.. This is my first review ever...and i am not Happy at all....my money is gone that is not even worth it...so small in actual appearance.😥\\n\"I used the battery once. And when I tried to charge it, it inflated and didn\\'t work any more.\"\\n\"Ordered an oil painting kit, and received 2 packs of minature glass fish instead. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money, because Holdfound no longer had the kit in stock.\"\\nDangerous!!!!!!<br />My friend bought this. My baby fell many times!!!!This should be 4 feet!\\n\"Its very cheaply made and the paint basically rubbed off but nice for a last minute gift fast, the glitter got on everything the heresy kiss was smashed the rose feel apart\"\\nBeware of Counterfeits !<br />cheap scrap .<br />not working properly .\\njunk\\nBroke within 90 days  very disappointed\\n\"Received two old, unusable batteries with writing on labels.  Very disappointed,  I want my money back.\"\\nCrap\\nOnly received partial package. Less than advertised. Better off buying a complete set with hose connection.\\nUnusable..\\nWish I had read the other reviews before buying.  The size is way too small (size of beads not shown anywhere in product description).  The quality of the beads is also very poor - lots of tags - sharp.  Bought for my grandchildren to use but even though they are 7 & 8 they were totally frustrated.  Even Grammy gave up trying to make something.  The tray is flimsy.  If I had not opened the package I would return it - I will be donating to Good Will and let their buyer beware.\\nThis plane was the most worst plane I have ever had it would not fly and it is not worth the price do not buy it\\nThis was terrible it ripped after the 3rd time using it!! Don\\'t waste your money!!!! 😩\\n\"ordered 4. Very poor sound. Time to record too short, about 5 sec! very disappointed in products.\"\\nfell apart before the performance begain.Dog looked nothing like the picture.\\nIt came apart after only a handful of uses\\nWon\\'t fire out of my Stryfe because the tips are to pointy and the dart heads come off really easily.\\n\"When I went to put the first pair on, the first one went on fine but the second one broke and beads spilled all over the floor.  So I couldn\\'t even wear them and have no idea if they stand up to actually being worn.<br /><br />I know these are not expensive but I\\'d rather pay a little more so that I get a product that can be worn AT LEAST ONCE. Geez!\"\\nway over priced\\nDidn\\'t even fit her high chair way to small\\nWhere sand bags attach to bouncer riped a hole on the first use this is not worth the money\\nYou can so tell by this pictures that theses figures are all fake. 😕 Do your research before buying a figure you want. I didn\\'t buy them but I thought everyone should know.\\nThIs was the biggest price of junk. Didn\\'t work from the first time we tried it. Not worth it to send back for refund.\\nWish I would have read the reviews before I wasted my money.  They are way too big for an infant and children who are walking can\\'t use them either.  The yarn looked like fine crochet thread to me and it is average weight yarn.  They are not cute at all.  the colors are pink and bright red making them look really cheesy.  Never again.\\nItem was not what is pictured.  I thought I was buying what the picure was but a skateboard unit came instead. My grandson was very disappointed\\n\"I\\'m highly disappointed in this purchase! I gave it as a gift to my 3yr old niece for her birthday. My brother and SIL said it came as just a huge box of pieces - no instructions, no ideas to use, nothing. I will not purchase these ever again. I\\'m so embarrassed!\"\\n\"These &#34;mood rings&#34; were terrible quality. I expected them to be a pretty cheap quality ring (which they were), but I did expect them to change color as stated in the description (which they did not…at all)! I tried on every single one and only two had even the slightest variation in color (and I tried each one when I was very warm and again when I was cold standing under my air-conditioning vent). The individual packaging and mood code were nice. It\\'s such a disappointment they did not work at all. Luckily Amazon was so easy to return and I\\'ll try another product, but what a waste of time and so embarrassing these are even sold.\"\\n\"put this in my fish tank, and it only works for 5 mins then stops, doesn\\'t go back on, doesn\\'t make any sense, u have to keep turning it on\"\\nIt was so paper thin. That was not put in the description. It was more like a part hat but it was put out there as an authentic cowboy hat\\nnot good for a birthday bag. very small. nothing fit inside.\\n\"DON\\'T BUY THIS!  All you will receive is one balloon, even though it specifically says and shows that you should receive 5 balloons.\"\\nIt stopped working after just a couple of days. We received a replacement item and it stopped working within a couple of weeks. My daughter only used it 3 or 4 times. This purchase was a big mistake.\\nIt broke when I hooked the hose up\\nit did not work\\n\"Bought it for my 4yr old\\'s birthday, and it has completely different decals on it. It doesn\\'t have enough power to move in much other than cement, carpet or a hard flat surface. It cannot climb up a sloped curb very well. The second time my son was using it, my 2yr old picked it up, and dropped it from waist level (~2ft high) right on the tires and it broke. It wasnt a throw, just a drop and one of the tires broke off. I don\\'t think it should have broken that easily, it didn\\'t land awkwardly. The suspension looks like it could handle a fall on all 4 tires, but it seems very fragile and doesn\\'t have the pep a small car like this should. It has great suspension, but its not powerful enough to use it. It stopped in bark dust, grass, and even got stuck in the space between two (new) slabs of cement sidewalk. Rear wheel drive doesn\\'t get the job done on any surface that would require the suspension. I was willing to overlook all of that because it did work well enough for my son, but after it broke I am very disappointed.\"\\nThe trucks won\\'t turn. Guess it will be a trophy\\nNot very bright .  Not worth it to purchase\\nDidn\\'t realize this had to be attached to a wall. So not quite what I expected. Cars go so fast you can\\'t even see them and not all hot wheels cars work on this product.\\n\"does not glow at all in the dark, or with black light, either.\"\\nThe edge\\'s are not as clean as the image would lead you to believe.\\n\"Horribly disappointed! Sent this as a gfit for our 3yr old niece and my brother and SIL said all they received was a huge box of JUST the pieces -- no instructions, no idea/project boards to use, nothing. I\\'m so stinkin annoyed and mad about this purchase!!!!!!!\"\\n\"My 9 year picked this game as a reward for getting her bloodwork done. Personally, I\\'d rather get stabbed with a needle than have to play it again. There are way too many elements and instructions. Keep the instuction manual handy because we had to refer to it at just about every turn. Even then, it\\'s confusing. Not like original Life at all.\"\\n\"Toddlers could not even put these hats on because the elastic stamps were so small. I don\\'t know who the manufacturer used as an example for measurement, but these could not even be used. I bought 2 packs. Hopefully this was a defective batch I bought. What a huge disappointment!\"\\n\"Have bought several robot kits from various manufacturers, so we are not new to this. But this one is, by far, ithe worst.  Difficult to put together, instructions are minimal and the pieces just don\\'t stay together.\"\\n\"THE PIECES DO NOT STAY TOGETHER. Directions are very bad and even after gluing the pieces with much difficulty, they would not stay together.  Granddaughters were very disappointed, and I wasted my money. Super frustrating! Would give 0 stars if that was an option.\"\\nI used it yesterday when i got it. Worked great loved it. Then i go to shot it today works then breaks outa nowhere. Darts wont shoot now. I was going to buy a nerf gun but then i saw this looked up reviews and people said they were better and durable. Big disappointment.\\nwould have returned it but too late the birthday was the day after I\\u200b got it. Cheap cars and poorly made\\nThis toy is a nice concept but does not work in reality. It is so extremely fragile that my 3 year old daughter cannot play with it. What good is a toy that she can\\'t touch. She is simply sitting ponies in it and pushing them down the slide. She does not play rough with it but with one wrong touch it falls apart. I would not recommend this toy to anyone with children who actually want to play with it.\\nto many duplications there was up to 30 of the same card\\n\"The concept of this puzzle is great, but the execution is very poor.  The internal mechanism on this puzzle (or the particular copy that I received) locks up so frequently that it makes solving the puzzle a tedious exercise in just trying to get a layer to turn in a particular direction.  Sometimes you need to spend 10 or so seconds just &#34;unlocking&#34; the turn so that you can complete the move.  It disrupts the whole flow of a sequence and often leads to a distraction that derails the particular sequence or move.<br /><br />For those who are familiar with other cubes, this is not the conventional &#34;lock up&#34; that occurs when you try to execute a sequence too fast and end up turning one layer into another.  This is a lockup in the internal mechanisms that allow the puzzle to turn.  It\\'s a little hard to articulate without seeing the inside of the cube, but you can tell from the sounds that something has caught.  This happens even when you are only turning the cube like a conventional 3x3x3, and not utilizing the turns unique to this puzzle which allow for turning corners when they are positioned in the center of the middle layers (45 degrees into a turn).<br /><br />I returned the unit I got and will not purchase another.\"\\nSeems like a great concept but in reality this air flow is so light that the bubble just drift out & float to earth without any interesting (for my dog at least) action.  Total waste of money.\\nIt looked liked it was photo copied.\\nWhat a poor quality\\ncheap kite you can get at the dollar store\\nI bought 2 so far only 1 works but cuts in and out! As I have seen on other reviews they have some problems. Purchase at own risk! If you get a good one it works great. My neibors have issued same.\\nLights did not work after 1/2 hour of use.  Cheap costume\\nThese things are soooooooo tiny!:(\\nIt won\\'t stay together and isn\\'t PVC as we tried to glue it with plumbers PVC glue. I sure wish it worked because it would be fun if it did.\\n\"Very disappointed. I got a game that looks used,  Game damaged. The box was taped. Not at all what we expected, the picture is different.\"\\nFor 200.00 you would think it would come with the right battery charger for the US\\nMy dog is 100lbs & it pretty much held him above water but he bit it the first day & punctured it.\\nBalloon was unable to be used due to hole.\\nvery weak on articulation and when i tried to move the arm the joint just tore right off which it isn\\'t supposed to do and i think it is too small\\n\"The \\'machines\\' and contraptions that are built fall apart immediately, and some can\\'t be built at all because of the poor, loose fit of the pieces.  Some of the designs don\\'t even seem possible if the pieces did fit together.  I have three different GoldieBlox sets bought on clearance, and this is the best one, unfortunately.  In my opinion, these sets undermine my daughter\\'s confidence in engineering and building because these unworkable toys scream that they are designed by a woman engineer for girls (cringe-worthy).  I know women engineers could do better and the pieces could certainly be manufactured with tighter tolerances.\"\\n\"If I could give it negative stars, I would!  It does not crush ice. It does not even come with any syrup or mix to make a slurpee - you go buy all the ingredients.  What\\'s the point of this thing?  Go buy an actual slurpee somewhere, then pour it in this machine to watch it dispense - that\\'s basically all it\\'s for.  Better yet, save your money & don\\'t buy this thing at all.  Just go buy a real slurpee if you want one.\"\\n\"Well I was very disappointed, it says in the heading Donald Duck &#34;CRYSTAL&#34; Puzzel............Well how shocked I was, when I opened it and it was ...... &#34;PLASTIC&#34;.  NOT HAPPY !!!\"\\n$2995!?!? You got to be kidding me\\n\"Not what I expected, didn\\'t realize they were decorations.  I bought them thinking kids would be able to wear them like regular play adhesive mustaches. Regardless, they didn\\'t come with nearly enough adhesive even for just decorations.\"\\n\"In the picture the bat ears are pin straight. The actual figure had uneven bending inwards. Other than that, cool figure.\"\\nMy son wanted this so badly for his room. The first one arrived and didn\\'t work at all. Wouldn\\'t even turn on. We exchanged it for another one. That one worked for about 5 minutes and then stopped. We sent that one back for a refund. We would still like to find one...that works. We will not attempt to purchase this brand again.\\n\"Extremely disappointed. Ordered 2 boats. Upon opening the first box (which had been modified using a cardboard piece to cover the gap when the flaps didn\\'t meet), discovered one of the propellers was broken. Opened the second box and, after charging the transmitter discovered it would not go forward--just left, right, and backwards. The transmitter that actually worked in the other box loses its charge within a very few minutes. I guess you get what you pay for, as the expression goes,--inexpensive but not worth a penny.\"\\nThe one I got had three centerpieces that had fallen off.  I returned it.  Poor quality control.  Maybe look at another brand or take your chances.\\nA Defective product with buttons not working and feeder mechanism malfunctioning.\\n\"This gun keeps jamming and when it doesn\\'t, it only shoots about four feet. If you bring this gun to a Nerf fight, you are going to get creamed.\"\\nDont want to even give it a star\\nDidn\\'t realize how small these are.\\nI expected flimsy hats (they are cheap after all) but these arrived dirty and with crooked decals. My hands got black smudges all over them from handling the hats. I had to go through and clean each one to be able to use them at a children\\'s party\\nIt arrived broken and did not work!\\nDon\\'t work!\\nCan\\'t get the kids portion up and running (and I work in tech) and there is absolutely no support for this product\\nLeaked right out of the box.  Absolutely terrible!  Our grandchildren were so excited to get it that my husband tried to patch.  A piece of junk!\\nI ordered the larger size so a $50 Dollar Bill would fit and Amazon sent me the smaller cheaper size that holds only a Gift Card it looks used and flimsy and cheap very disappointed\\n\"Horrible.  We gave it to my son for Christmas and it was broken in two places before we could even fly it (Unbreakable??!!)  We had to buy replacement parts, but now the batteries don\\'t recharge.  We did get to fly it a couple of times and it was very hard to fly if there is any wind at all.  Big waste of money.\"\\nIt just perfect n I really love it\\nWe recived wrong order\\n\"I got these hoping my one year old could play with them for awhile but they only lasted one use before the crayons themselves were falling out of the little adorable holder.  Not impressed.  If you want them for a one time use, maybe get this, but otherwise pass.\"\\n\"Did not even have it 24 hours and the wheel broke off. My daughter is only 15 months, so all she did was just push it around. So I glued the wheel until I can get her a different one.\"\\nTread wheels broke in the first day of use and I had it fixed but then it broke again by just driving it forward\\n\"Awful aweful, this thing is clunky and comes apart at the slightest provocation! It\\'s already in the trash and my lil guy just got it about a month ago. The only thing we kept was the bench, tree, merry go round and the people. Waste of money!\"\\n\"Although the color looks like a light beige, the actual color is a murky green. Very disappointed since I purchased it to display it in my living, believing the color was as it appears in the advertised pictures.\"\\nNo they don\\'t even pop when you throw them.\\n\"When we received this ring we quickly went outside to throw around.  We discovered there was no way to play with this in a neighborhood.  It goes a long way with very little effort, but it has a hard shell within the rubber which could easily scratch a car, injure someone or even break a window.  We then took the ring to the school near us and had a great time with it as the claims of distance they give are definitely possible.  Six and nine year old boys  could throw this a long ways.  In the next two weeks we took it to parks and other schools.  Everyone who threw it was impressed and could not believe the distance it traveled and how easy it was to catch.  Then the BUMMER!  The inner black rigid part covered with rubber broke just from normal use.  Sure, we can still use it but the only thing holding it together is a little bit of the rubber surround.  This ring was a 5+ when we first got it but having broke in the first two weeks, I can only give it a 1 star.  With the design as it is, not sure how this company will have very many repeat orders.  We were very disappointed.  Returning for refund.\"\\nIt\\'s a piece of junk...doesn\\'t charge multiple batteries as advertised\\nReally small\\nIt is contained in glass which is dangerous if you are barefoot.\\n\"Fake. Not original. Every time my 5 yr old kid sees the original friends m Bandai, it says &#34;dad, this is the real one, not the one you gave me&#34;. Feels and looks very cheap. Joints are loose.\"\\nPoor quality\\n'"

    "First, the analysis above does not take consideration of the repetition. For example, it is very possible that the user included differenr words that indicate the same person, such as son, he, and him, in the same review. A possible method can be going through a review one by one and see if contains any word that tells who the gift was for (using for loop for each review and another for loop to go through the male/female list) and get the unique count. Unfortunately, this does not seem very efficient way for now and might be conflicted if the review contains information for both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we may not know which occasion the gift was for unless it was specifically written in the review. For a more accurate analysis in future, it may be helpful to know the dates when the toys were ordered to more accurately infer the occasion of the gift. User information (birthday or past orders) would also be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, if the purchase was not intended as a gift but something the reviewer purchased for him/herself, the count analysis can be limited as it is difficult to determine whether the reviewer is a male or female. Therefore, the user gender information should be taken into consideration.\n",
